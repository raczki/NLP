Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume. Do you know where I could find him? I think he\\'s taking the next train to Capital City. The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound. Yes, and it\\'s been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point. I see he touched you, too. Hey, thanks for your vote, man. I didn\\'t vote. Voting\\'s for geeks. Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls. We forgot. Well, don\\'t sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse? Uh oh. Lewis? Somebody must have voted. What about you, Bart? Didn\\'t you vote? Uh oh. Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy! I demand a recount. One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount? No. Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin. This way, Mister President! Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, andâ€¦.. Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Lisa. Hey, Lisa, indeed. What? What is it? Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that? Ah, I\\'m sorry, Lisa. You know, it\\'s the life of the substitute teacher: he\\'s a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he\\'s speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what. You can\\'t go! You\\'re the best teacher I\\'ll ever have. Ah, that\\'s not true. Other teachers will come along who... Oh, please. No, I can\\'t lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City. But I need you too. That\\'s the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more. I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I\\'m going to miss you. I\\'ll tell you what... Whenever you feel like you\\'re alone and there\\'s nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know. Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom. All aboard! So, I guess this is it? It you don\\'t mind I\\'ll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life? Goodbye, Lisa honey. It\\'ll be okay. Just read the note. Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything? Bart didn\\'t get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about? Nothing. Lisa, tell your father. Mr. Bergstrom left today. Oh. He\\'s gone. Forever. And? I didn\\'t think you\\'d understand. Hey, just because I don\\'t care doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t understand. I\\'m glad I\\'m not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I\\'m about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon! Me? Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon! I don\\'t think you realize what you\\'re saying. Baboon! Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can\\'t believe it was her. Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all! Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There\\'s a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy. Go Away. Lisa, don\\'t hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon? No! Nuts. This isn\\'t going well at all. Look, if you just want me to forgive you -- No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say. Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I\\'m lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof. That was our wedding. Oh. Children, it\\'s time for you to go to bed. It\\'s true. Now, you\\'ll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There\\'s probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can\\'t explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I\\'m good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean? Yeah. I can hold these nails in place with my tail. You\\'re so silly. Gimme a banana. I don\\'t have any banana. Come on, you\\'re holding out on me. I\\'m sorry I called you a baboon, Dad. Think nothing of it. Hey, what\\'s the matter, son? Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted... Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president? No. Would you have to do extra work? Yeah. And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh? Well, no. So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That\\'s my motto. Hey! Thanks, monkey-man. Holy-moly... talk about parenting! Uh oh. Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three. Homie, did you straighten everything out...? Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don\\'t say anything, Marge. Let\\'s just go to bed. I\\'m on the biggest roll of my life. Mmm... hors doovers. Homer! You promised! I promised I wouldn\\'t eat? Never! You lie! Homer, please. We\\'ve never thrown a party. Now we\\'re gonna pay back all the friends who\\'ve invited us to their homes. But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults. Yeah, you can\\'t have any fun in bed. Oh son, when you\\'re older, you\\'ll know better. Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah. Oh! They\\'re here! How does everything look? How do I look? Do we have enough glasses? Do we have enough gag ice cubs? Homer! Homer! Put a record on! What are all our friends names again? Children! Go! Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology. College boy. Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch? Why not? I paid for it. Hey, Flanders, next time why don\\'t you put a little alcohol in it? Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor. Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you\\'re right! Give me another. Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield\\'s party when you threw up in the laundry hamper? No. Hi! You\\'re Homer\\'s sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don\\'t remember you being so beau --tiful. Ow! Hey! Jeez! Is that a new kind of Mace? It\\'s really painful. Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party? Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink. It was me! You fell for it! Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary. Please Dad. You should see the look on your face. It\\'s priceless. Bart! Come over here. What? You little monkey... you\\'re a little monkey, aren\\'t you? Yes sir. Bart, do that thing you do that\\'s so cute. What? That thing you know how to do. What? Go to bed. Hey, everybody! Look, I\\'m the funniest guy in the world! Oh, Homer, you\\'re the king! I\\'ve been wantin\\' to tell you off for years, but I\\'ve never had the nerve. Homer, I don\\'t know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago. You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit! Uh, gee Homer, don\\'t quit... All right then. Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude? Oh sure. Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom. Hey, thanks for invitin\\' me. I had a wonderful time. I must apologize for my husband. If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side. Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming. Remember, I said if. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. Why? What\\'d you do? Marge! Come here! Where-where are we going? Shhh. I want to make sure the kids don\\'t hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting. They\\'re fighting in the car again. That music always sends a chill down my spine. Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night? The way I acted? So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini. Good lord! There\\'s a fly in my drink! I put it there. You did? I slipped it into your glass as a gag. Pure hilarity! Pure Homer! I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season! Homer, I like to think that I\\'m a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn\\'t just cross that line, you threw up on it! I\\'m sorry, honey. Can\\'t we just forget it and go to church. I\\'m going to church alone today. You\\'re going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life. No, I didn\\'t... I... Oh, you mean inside, don\\'t you? About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don\\'t understand why. I understand why. You were wasted. I admit it. I didn\\'t know when to say when. I\\'m sorry it happened and I just hope you didn\\'t lose a lot of respect for me. Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will. Aw. Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week\\'s sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including \"Bible Bafflers\", \"Satan\\'s Boners,\" \"Good Grief! More Satan\\'s Boners\" and, for the teens, \"It\\'s Not Cool To Fry In Hell.\" Marge, Marge. I\\'m sorry. The Lord and I can\\'t compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson\\'s shoes. Why don\\'t we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat? Sorry, Reverend. Sit down, Homer. Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It\\'s psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread... ... or those just in need of a tune-up. Hmmmm. Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over. Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat? Oh, well, it\\'s very tempting. Really a wonderful idea. Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?! We\\'ll be there! Marriage encounter weekend, here I come! Now you wanna go? They\\'re holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn\\'t call it Catfish Lake if it didn\\'t have a catfish in it. We\\'re going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that\\'s all. No fishing. Oh, that must be the babysitter. Hello. I\\'m Mrs. Simpson. Simpson... Simpson... Come back for more, eh? Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice? Oh dear. If we can\\'t find a babysitter, we can\\'t go. What a kick in the teeth. What do you need a babysitter for? I\\'m almost ten and a half. Mom! You wouldn\\'t dare. Don\\'t take that tone with me, young lady, or I\\'ll give you a taste of the back of me hand. No, you don\\'t! Grampa? Huh... who?... what? Grampa, could you do something? I can dress myself. Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn\\'t ask, except I\\'m desperate. Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can\\'t be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone\\'s agin me. I\\'ll do it. Marge, just puttin\\' a few last things in the trunk. Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this... Just give me the list. I can read. All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves. Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub. I heard that. Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It\\'s a list of the things Lisa and I can and can\\'t do. Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You\\'re allowed smoke cigars? Hmmm, bait. Whoa, better get some gas. Fill \\'er up. I guess I\\'ll go and stretch my legs. Where ya headed? Catfish Lake. Oh, after General Sherman, are ya? Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who\\'s General Sherman? He\\'s only the biggest catfish in these parts... Oh yeah. ... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds. Whoa, who says that? They do. Oh. Now, that there\\'s the only known picture of the General. Can\\'t see what he is, exactly. He\\'s freakishly big, though. Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman! After the supermarket, we\\'ll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade. Bart, Grampa\\'s a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it\\'s right to take advantage of him? Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who\\'s to say what\\'s right or wrong? But right now my gut\\'s telling me... Bleed Gramps dry. Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome! Hello, Reverend. We\\'re glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen. Hel-lo Marge! Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine? None of your business, Flanders. Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing? Oh, I\\'m afraid not. A marriage can\\'t be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that. Oh. We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won\\'t be the one that got away. I see. I also understand bowling expressions. Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don\\'t we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they\\'re here. John... Gloria? My name\\'s Gloria. I\\'m here because Johnny boy hasn\\'t been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I\\'d want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me. That\\'s enough, Gloria! Thank you, Gloria. John, why don\\'t you tell us a little about why you\\'re here? She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She\\'s the Queen of the Harpies. No, I\\'m not! Queen of the Harpies! No, I\\'m not! Here\\'s your crown, your Majesty. Get away from me, swine. Queen of the Harpies! You\\'ve come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other\\'s eyes. Your eyes? I\\'d forgotten how beautiful they are. Let\\'s never fight again. We were fools to argue. Let\\'s not talk about that. Let\\'s not talk at all. Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here? Well... Go on, Neddie. Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can\\'t find hers. Lucky you don\\'t keep guns in the house. Homer, why are you here? Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress. No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don\\'t you tell us about hers? She\\'s perfect. Come on, Homer. What are her faults? Well, sometimes that can be annoying. Oh, Homer. Now, Marge. Don\\'t interrupt. You\\'ll get your turn. I\\'m done. Okay. Marge? Well, it\\'s not that I don\\'t love the guy. I\\'m always sticking up for him. It\\'s just that he\\'s so self-centered. Now, Homer. He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes... It\\'s true. It\\'s all true. Homer, don\\'t interrupt. Sorry. He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle... I only did that a couple of times. Half a gallon of chocolate. Check. Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge. Check. Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip. Check. Did your Mom really write that shopping list? Grampa, what a question? What\\'s next, Lis? Sprinkles and syrup. Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it. Well, all right, but put out that cigar. ... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that\\'s it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That\\'s all I can think of right now. I guess you\\'re all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest. Well, we\\'ve missed the luau. What say we call it a night? I don\\'t want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book. You know, kids, it\\'s gettin\\' pretty late. Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We\\'ve had a big day. It\\'s no use kidding myself. I\\'m having an ethical crisis. Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime. Homer, you\\'re sneaking out to go fishing? I can\\'t believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we\\'re here trying to save our marriage. You\\'re thinking about fishing, even when I\\'m talking... right now. Right? Would this be a good time to be honest? Yes. You\\'re right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy? Get back in bed. No. All right. But I can\\'t sleep. Can I take a walk? Sure. Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband. Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA! Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it. Homer? Sugar? Yes. Ten please. Hey Grampa, top me off. Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee? For the last time, yes! Good! Give up! Huh? Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old. Bart\\'s joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square. Tell my friends? All right, but I\\'ve got some pretty funky friends. All right! I get out at noon and I\\'m already invited to a party. Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you. Do I have to do this? No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn\\'t recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I\\'ve ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It\\'s all his fault, and I\\'m willing to put that in a certificate you can frame. Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there. That the Yanks are comin\\'... Okay, fish, you\\'re probably wondering why I\\'m still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show. Whoa! Holy mackerel! Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What\\'s happening, man? Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight? Not yet, but the afternoon is young. Lisa, what\\'s wrong? Isn\\'t it obvious? We\\'ve degraded ourselves and set back the children\\'s rights movement for decades to come. You\\'re great at a party, Lisa. Really great. Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh! OW! Haw haw haw! You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt? Yeah. All right. I\\'ll show you. Haw! Haw! Haw! Doggone it! I love you, but I must kill you. Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey, nice tie, Nelson.. Ah, thanks, it\\'s your dad\\'s. I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! I\\'m a feeb... a useless old... worn-out... Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I\\'ve never had before. It\\'s called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth. Well, how do you make this feeling go away? You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before. I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD! Uh, oh. Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How\\'s the marriage retreat going? Please Dad. We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe.... Marge, you don\\'t know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero. To who? To those weirdos in the worm store. All this fish represents is just how selfish you are. Well, if that\\'s the way you feel... I\\'ll throw it back. Oh yeah, sure. Watch. Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you\\'re telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby. Ohhh, Homer. We\\'re back! How\\'s your marriage? Same as usual. Perfectomundo. Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what\\'s your secret? Pretending to cry. That\\'s right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I\\'m crying, I\\'m so sad. Way to go, Grampa. I\\'ll never trust another old person. I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee. Yup. General Sherman. They say he\\'s 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don\\'t you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he\\'s a hundred years if he\\'s a day. And uh, no one\\'s ever caught him? Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell. Hurry, Mom! If we don\\'t get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone. Wow! Number nine! That\\'s before Fallout Boy became his ward. What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost. I think it\\'s sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity. Well, you know what I think? I think Casper\\'s the ghost of Richie Rich. Hey, they do look alike! I wonder how Richie died? Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life. Kids, could you lighten up a little? Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool. He\\'s no wittier than the next superhero. Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, \"Hot enough for ya?\" I stand corrected. We\\'re here! Too bad we didn\\'t come dressed as popular cartoon characters. This looks like a discount for... Bartman! Who are you supposed to be? I\\'m Bartman! Never heard of him. Full price. Lousy rip off... Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I\\'d like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy. Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. You might say I feel like Radiation Man! That\\'s Radioactive Man, jerk! I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. Get that punk\\'s name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby. Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear? Please Dad. Let\\'s see, we\\'ve got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid. Hey, Bart-dude! Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what\\'s that? My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It\\'s about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone! Cool! C\\'mon, Bart. We\\'re going to see Buddy Hodges. The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV? Yep. Wow, I guess he wasn\\'t killed in Vietnam. Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil. Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies. Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you\\'re sixteen. Look out! Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth? Well, wasn\\'t that great?... Y\\'know, kids, I\\'m sure we\\'d all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let\\'s keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy \"Fallout Boy\" Hodges! Any questions? When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too? I am sure I don\\'t know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of \"Cats\" -- anybody see it? Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me. Yes, you, the masked boy. Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found? Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can\\'t you little vultures leave him alone? Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It\\'s the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl. Tell you what. I\\'ll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep \\'em there. Behold! Wow. Radioactive Man Number One. None other. I bet it\\'s worth a million bucks! It is, my lad. But I\\'ll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me. All I got is thirty. Then you cannot have it. But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book. Your emotion is out of place here, son. So, did you kids have fun? Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes. Ohhh. I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time. Homer! I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat! All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger! All right, what are you getting at? I need a hundred dollars for a comic book. A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo? Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world. Well, t.s. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No. Please Dad. No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I\\'m not mad at you for trying. It shows you\\'ve been paying attention. But we all know I\\'m not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? No. Are you? Okay. Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo! Don\\'t gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn\\'t give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma... We\\'ll give you half our allowance. Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave. This gives us a lot more free time. Uh-huh. Let\\'s take up smoking. For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked... Venus... Oh, Venus... We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried. Haw haw! Here we are. But the big day finally came. And because I\\'d worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good. So maybe a part-time job is the answer. Aw, Mom, I couldn\\'t ask you to do that. You\\'re already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful -- She means you should get a job, stupid. Me? Get a job! Were they serious? I didn\\'t realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever. Bart! What are you staring at? Uh... nothing. He didn\\'t say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever... Bart! Stop it! Sorry. I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH Empty bottles... empty bottles... Hm... well, it\\'s practically empty. Here you go, Apu. Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie? No, not today. I need the dime. Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade. Ah-ha! Americanize this, my good man. Okey dokey. All those coins were only worth three lousy cents? Let the good times roll. Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek. How\\'s it going, Bart? Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one\\'s buying. Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see... Ah ha, now you look pathetic. Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let\\'s see... ... Ah! Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up. Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I\\'m a little short this week. Beat it. Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella? Ugh, my dog ate it. Gotta have a license to sell beer. Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house? We-ell, seeing as how it\\'s a first offense... I guess we can overlook this. So long, officers. Uh-oh. Hey, what\\'s all the -- My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer. The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book. A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, \"Nazi Smasher\"? I don\\'t think so. Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don\\'t he? Mrs. Glick? Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you\\'ve got a strong young back! Would you like something to eat? I\\'ve got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy. No, thanks. Who\\'s that? Oh, that\\'s my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long. This one\\'s for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain\\'t so stuck-up once you get to know... Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy. No, thanks. Boys love candy. Oh, yes, ma\\'am! Ugh, I think I\\'d rather just get to work, Ma\\'am. We\\'ll start with a little light yard work. And when you\\'re done, you can have a nice barley pop. I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds? All of \\'em? Good boy. Now be careful with these. I\\'ll be inside watching my stories. Ow!. . .Ow! Jack, please. I\\'m married. That must be what\\'s turning me on. Oh... Stop it... some more. Filthy, but genuinely arousing. Finished. Merciful heavens, you\\'re bleeding! I\\'ll get the iodine. Now, don\\'t fidget. Listen, lady, you don\\'t have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH! They\\'ve never improved on iodine. Hi, Mom. Did you make any money? Not yet, but at least I\\'m in a lot of pain. Well, I think what you\\'re doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn\\'t have anybody. There\\'s a reason. The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don\\'t it? I\\'ll sludge you, you old bat. Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is? Some old lady thing, nobody\\'s heard about for fifty years? No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress. Great story, lady. Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms. No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH! Well, it\\'s payday. I\\'ll wager you\\'ve been looking forward to this. Two quarters. Two quarters? You deserve every penny. You know, I\\'ve told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too. Two quarters! Bart, you didn\\'t say thank you. Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there\\'s no way that I am saying thank you. You\\'re welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies. Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her... What\\'s the problem, boy? I\\'ve been bustin\\' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents. Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money. Really? Nah. Dad, I\\'ve done everything I could and I\\'ve only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps. Son, I\\'m proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out. Can you let me have it for forty dollars? Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that? It\\'s all I\\'ve got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God\\'s sake! No way. What do you want? Can I have it for thirty-five? No!... No!... Freakin\\' kids. I do not need this, I\\'ve got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology. Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns? Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain\\'t got it, I ain\\'t gettin\\' off the stool. Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of \"Radioactive Man No. 1\" right now! Wow! Here you go. \"Muttonchop Yaz.\" I don\\'t want it. Freakin\\' kids! Look, pal. We\\'ve got a hundred bucks and we\\'d like to buy \"Radioactive Man No. 1\". So why don\\'t you just waddle over there and get it. Yes sir. Wow! Breathe it in, boys! This is the stuff dreams are made of. It smells like my grandpa. Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home. Uh-oh. Looks like you bought more than you bargained for. My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb! Yaarrgh! I\\'m becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man. So that\\'s how it happened! I would\\'ve thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him. Now you know better. Turn the page, Bart. Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like. Why can\\'t we keep it at my house? Your house? That\\'s crazy talk! Well, the comic\\'s ours as much as it is yours. How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays. Perfect. Wait a minute. What about Sunday? Yeah. What about Sunday? Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine. Perfect. Wait a minute. What about zero? Yeah! What about zero? Yeah. Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by \"Rock, Scissor, Paper\" competition. Best three out of five, how\\'s that? Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I\\'ll be taking my comic and... Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here. If the comic book stays right here, then so do I. Me too! Fine. We\\'re all going to stay here with the comic book. It\\'ll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That\\'s what pals do, right? Real friendly-like. I want to read it again. Nice try, mister. Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it. What do you mean, the last one alive? I meant years from now. Yeah, sure you did. Bart, don\\'t push him! I knew it. You\\'re both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson. I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s\\'mores. Thank you, Mrs. Simpson. Sweet dreams, boys. One more step and you\\'re a dead man. I have to go to the bathroom, Bart. Yeah, right, so do I, but you don\\'t see me gettin\\' up. Hey, what\\'s going on? Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book. Let\\'s tie him up! Bart, is this how you treat all your guests? Hmp, impressive. Quiet, Piggy, or we\\'ll stick an apple in your mouth. We can\\'t take any chances. We\\'ll have to take turns watching him. Okay. I\\'ll go first. Oh, so that\\'s your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham! Well, it is not going to happen, see? You\\'re going crazy, Bart. I\\'m telling your mom! Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers. I don\\'t know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom? You can\\'t stop me. The hell I can\\'t! Homer, it\\'s really coming down. Could you check on the boys? They\\'re fine. Bart, the comic! Don\\'t let go of me Bart! Milhouse, it\\'s not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit. No, Bart! No! You know, if you guys hadn\\'t tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak. Shut up! Shut up! Help me, Bart! I didn\\'t even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns. Boys, you better come in the house. You don\\'t want to get the sniffles. Aw, Mom. Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I\\'ve got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows? I\\'d raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could. It\\'s no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came. We worked so hard and now it\\'s all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can\\'t share. What\\'s your point? Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off. Well, the world is safe again... but for how long? Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do. Joke\\'s on them. If the core explodes, there won\\'t be any power to light that sign. And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong. Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag! Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries! Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We\\'ve got to get a doctor! Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there\\'s an ounce of strength left in me, I... Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman\\'s terms it\\'s quite simply a lack of blood. Damn it, doctor, I\\'m no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it? Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion. How long does it take to sterilize a needle? A few seconds. Well, skip it. Just leave me enough to get home. I\\'m afraid it\\'s not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It\\'s quite rare. But I\\'m B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins! Smithers, don\\'t feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot. How many hairs on my head? Without looking! Go ahead. Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death ... death\\'s door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all. I\\'d give him my blood, except for one thing. What\\'s that? I don\\'t wanna. I can\\'t believe you guys. There\\'s a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don\\'t wanna cash in? That\\'s why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job. You know, Homer, I am your supervisor. Sorry, sir. Maggie, look. What\\'s that? Lee-mur. Lee-mur. Zee-boo. Zee-boo. What are you doing, honey? I\\'m trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn\\'t end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn\\'t have. Lisa, we did the best we could... What\\'s a zebu? It\\'s like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap. Marge! Marge! What\\'s my blood type? A-Positive. Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don\\'t have it. You know his blood type, how romantic. A mother knows everything about her family. Oh, yeah? What\\'s my shoe size? Four B. How many teeth do I have? Sixteen permanent, eight baby. Earmuffs. XL. Ring. I don\\'t want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three. Allergies. Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch. And? Glow in the dark monster make-up. Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type? Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn\\'t get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it. Bart does. Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You\\'ve got a date with a needle! Hey, wait a minute. I don\\'t have to give blood. I have rights, you know. Yeah, you have the right to remain silent. Bart, you have to help someone in need. It\\'s the only decent thing to do. Bart, it\\'s not like I\\'m asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You\\'re a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man\\'s life, he showers you with riches. Don\\'t you know the story of Hercules and the Lion? Is it a Bible story? Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches. How did a lion get rich? It was the olden days! Oh. Hey, let\\'s go! Emergency! Life-or-death here! Just a sec, man! Whoa, Otto-man! You work here? Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude. Now let\\'s get the show on the road. Okay. Let me wash up. Homer, brave young Bart. I don\\'t know which one to hug first. Eh.... the boy. We\\'re ready with the transfusion. Smithers, I\\'m not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph. Charles... Montgomery... Burns. Um, hmm. American Patriot ... American Patriot. Master Of The Atom. Scourge Of The Despot. \"O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!\" Smithers, I\\'m back! Oh, top o\\' the mornin\\' to ye! Why, look who\\'s here! It\\'s good old... you! Hi, Mr. Burns. Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm? Mr. Burns... he\\'s okay! Jackpot! Aye, caramba! Heh-heh-heh! Well, that\\'s game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo! Smithers, I\\'m back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar! Just remarkable, sir. You know, it\\'s funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad\\'s name? Uh, Bart Simpson, sir. Who? He\\'s the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G. Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo! Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let\\'s do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see! Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something! Yes, Dad. It\\'s a little thin, but that\\'s okay, could be a check. The meaning of what? \"Better half,\" Marge. \"Better half.\" All right, there\\'s no check, just a card. But don\\'t panic. I\\'m sure it tells us what we\\'re getting and where we can pick it up. \"Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.\" It\\'s just a card! This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That\\'s what got me so mad in the first place. Homer, you don\\'t do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand. Marge, you\\'re my wife and I love you very much. But you\\'re living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats... Yeah, Mom. We got hosed! Bart! We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance. I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I\\'ve had it! Bart, take a letter. \"Dear Mr. Burns. I\\'m so glaaad you enjoyed my son\\'s blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can\\'t tell, I\\'m being sarcastic. You stink!\" Could you read that last part back to me? You stink. Good. \"You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like...\" An elephant\\'s butt? An elephant\\'s butt. But he\\'s your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute? Yup! You\\'re still angry, Homer. Why don\\'t you sleep on it? Forget it, Marge! Please, Homie? For me? Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works. Cheap son-of-a... Homer... Breakfast is ready. Hmmm... Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y\\'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph. Oh... thank you. Where\\'s the letter? Where is it? Homer, I don\\'t think it\\'s in the cornstarch canister. Well, it\\'s somewhere! It didn\\'t just get up and walk away! Bart, have you seen the letter? Yup. All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last? The last place I saw it... Uh huh. ...was in my hand... Yeah... ...as I was shoving it into the mailbox. Why did you do that? Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You\\'re an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you\\'d be mad in the morning. So I... I\\'ll show you mad in the morning. Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself. She\\'s right. Okay, think, Homer. Don\\'t panic. They don\\'t pick up the mail till noon. There\\'s still time! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Give it up, Homer. It\\'s locked up tight. Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy. Hey, I\\'m with you, Homer. Fight the power! Why the hose, Homer? What does it look like? I\\'ll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it. Yeah, but don\\'t other people have mail in there? So a few people won\\'t get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: \"Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo.\" Big loss. Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal. Dad, the mailman is here. That\\'s a good one. We\\'ll use that. No, I mean the mailman\\'s here. Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail? Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn\\'t do any good to run, \\'cause you\\'re our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh? That\\'s right. Well, I\\'m still gonna run! I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia. Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business. He\\'s written \"Like Hell I Can\\'t!\"... \"Up From The Muck\"... and \"The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!\" Excellent. All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous? Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I\\'m not some dizzy starlet who can\\'t string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You\\'re fired. Okay, Mr. Burns. What\\'s your first name? I don\\'t know. Great plan, Bart. Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron. Lisa, I don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, but it\\'s very strange and your father is trying to worry. \"Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results.\" Oops. Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take. Can I help you? They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it. Oh, don\\'t be frightened of this. It\\'s nothing but a letter opener. Who are you? Homer Simpson. Yeah, well I\\'ll be on my -- Hello, there\\'s more. \"In case you can\\'t tell, I\\'m being sarcastic...\" \"...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed...\" \"...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant\\'s butt!\" Hey, c\\'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm? Homer, I don\\'t tell you how to do your job. Okay? I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I\\'ll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I\\'ll just crush him like an ant. \"Senile,\" eh? \"Buck-toothed,\" am I? \"Bony arms,\" are they? \"Liver spots,\" did I? \"Chinless,\" will you? His pink slip awaits your signature, sir. Now, that\\'s odd. I\\'ve just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp. But, sir -- But what? Nothing, sir. Oh, I\\'ve never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he\\'s always kinda mad. Me and my big... letter writing pen! Honey, what\\'s done is done. No matter what happens, we\\'ll pull through. We always do. Okay, here\\'s the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I\\'ll... die in a gutter. It\\'s practical and within our means. That\\'s okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you. You know Homer Simpson? Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him once in a while. Hmmm huh. We uh, need him beaten up. You got it. Wait! What is it? Ah, nothing. Wait! What? Beat, but don\\'t kick. Hold the kicks. Got it. Wait! What? Uh, um, umm... Hey, what did Homie do anyway? He saved Mr. Burns\\' life! In closing, gentle reader, I\\'d like to thank you. What\\'s that you say? Me thanking you? No, it\\'s not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end. Ah Smithers, how\\'d the beating go? Sir, uh... there was no beating. What? Well that\\'s a hell of a thing! Why? Because... I... I called it off. Judas! I\\'m sorry, sir. But I just couldn\\'t hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life. I see. I know you\\'re mad at me, but I think it\\'s only fair to warn you, I\\'m going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me. No need, Smithers. As usual, you\\'ve been the sober \"ying\" to my raging \"yang.\" Put \\'er there, old pal. Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I\\'m, I\\'m afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to. We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed. Moe\\'s Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink. Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch. Hold on, I\\'ll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately? Listen you little puke. One of these days I\\'m gonna catch you, and I\\'m gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick. What\\'s the matter Homer? You\\'re not your normal effervescent self. I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one. Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems. Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills. We\\'ll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present! Ooo, too practical. Too cutesy-poo. Too cornball. A pool table? Are you mad? I\\'m not gonna turn his home into a saloon. Eureka! We\\'ve found it! B-but, sir... it\\'s thirty-two thousand dollars. Don\\'t you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It\\'s perfect! Oh, woe is me. Oh, my! It\\'s Mr. Burns. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Wait, Dad, he\\'s smiling. Mr. Burns, you brought us a present. Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp? To show there\\'s no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, \"Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?\" And now, young fellow, I haven\\'t forgotten you. Here. Wow! A crowbar! It\\'s to open the crate, stupid. What did I tell you? I\\'ll bet it\\'s filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls... Wow! A big ugly head! Actually, son, it\\'s a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt\\'tapalatakettle, the god of war. Awesome! No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec. Marge, what does it do? It doesn\\'t do anything. Marge! Really, what does it do? Whatever it does, it\\'s doing it now. Well, I\\'ll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt\\'tapalatakettle. Ta! Did you see their faces, Smithers? Sir, you\\'re my god of generosity. Save a guy\\'s life, and whattaya get? Nothin\\'! Worse than nothin\\'! Just a big, scary rock. Hey, man, don\\'t bad-mouth the head. Homer, it\\'s the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, \"A good deed is its own reward.\" Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool! Well then, I guess the moral is, \"No good deed goes unrewarded.\" Wait a minute. If I hadn\\'t written that nasty letter, we wouldn\\'t have gotten anything! Well... then I guess the moral is, \"The squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" Perhaps there is no moral to this story. Exactly. It\\'s just a bunch of stuff that happened. But it certainly was a memorable few days! Amen to that! Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart. Lisa? It\\'s six a.m. Something\\'s wrong! Dad died! No, no. He\\'s fine. Well, what do you know? I\\'m relieved. Bart, my birthday is in two days. I\\'m gonna be eight years old. It\\'s a big number -- almost double digits. Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn\\'t taste as good anymore -- Lisa did it. Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out? Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don\\'t he? Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I\\'ve made things for you. But you\\'ve lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we\\'ll forget all... Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it\\'s done! I\\'m doing it! Birthday gift coming your way! Oh, thank you. Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry. Can do. Hm... Krusty hotline. Hi kids! You\\'ve reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven\\'t asked your parents\\' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute. Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day. Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister! I tried to stop her but she overpowered me. Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt? I washed it. Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink? Marge, I can\\'t wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I\\'m not popular enough to be different. Now Homer, don\\'t panic. You have plenty of white shirts. Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It\\'s all over, Marge. It\\'s all over. I don\\'t know how this could have happened. Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle! You! You did this to me! Homer, please. No one\\'s going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work. Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink? Oh, that\\'s Homer Simpson, sir. He\\'s one of your boobs from Sector 7-G. Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he\\'s some sort of free-thinking anarchist. I\\'ll call security, sir. Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves. Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut. It has pink frosting! Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I\\'m wearing a pink shirt, it doesn\\'t mean I\\'m some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting -- Drop that doughnut. Let\\'s go, Pinky. You don\\'t understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry... Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away! You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he\\'s telling the truth. Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in \\'79. Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore. Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here? Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient\\'s sanity took months. That\\'s all changed, thanks to the \"Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test.\" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is. Print name? Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form. Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can\\'t fill this out for you. All right, all right. I\\'ll get Lisa to do it. Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me? LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote. O-kay. Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn\\'t that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, -- No deal. Dad, maybe you should do this. Son, it\\'s no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot? Oh, yeah. Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: \"Man Breaking Hip.\" Dog on Fire. Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog? Look at him! And finally, \"Baby With A Nail Gun.\" Awww. Okay, it\\'s time to cast your votes now. Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire! Hey, Dad. \"Do you hear voices?\" Yes, I\\'m hearing one right now, while I\\'m trying to watch TV. Yes. \"Are you quick to anger?\" Bart! Shut up or I\\'ll shut you up! Yes. \"Do you wet your pants?\" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident. So, did I pass? No. Careful, men. He wets his pants. The devil with his fly open. Right... That\\'s a spill on a floor with bugs goin\\' after it. They\\'re gonna eat it. Good... Arrghh! HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / The boy! This isn\\'t fair! How can you tell who\\'s sane and who\\'s insane? Well, we have a very simple method. Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane. Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he\\'s a little black guy. Who are you? Hi. I\\'m Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons. I\\'m Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons. I can\\'t believe you\\'ve never heard of me. I\\'m a very popular entertainer. Oh, of course I\\'ve heard of you. I mean you\\'d have to be living under a rock not to know -- what\\'d you say your name was? Michael Jackson. Doesn\\'t ring a bell. Thriller? What was that last one? Thriller. Nope. Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE\\'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE! Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet? The moonwalk? No, that thing with your feet. Here look. Just raise your heel a bit and put a little pressure on the ball of your foot. Hee hee hee... You seem like a nice guy. Why\\'d they put you in here? Because I wore a pink shirt. I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed. What\\'d you wear? One white glove, covered with rhinestones. Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl-- Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us? Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis. Hey, Michael, I don\\'t get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me. Homer, this is Floyd. He\\'s an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that. Okay. Five times nine. Forty-five. Wowww. We call this guy the Chief. He\\'s been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle. Hey, Chief. Hello. Well, it\\'s about time somebody reach out to me. Gee, I gotta call my family. Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling \\'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I\\'m a god. I could call them for you. Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight. Joe\\'s Crematorium. You kill \\'em, we grill \\'em. Hello. Who is this? I\\'m Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? I\\'m Michael Jackson. The Michael Jackson? No way! It\\'s true. I\\'m with your father, in a mental institution. Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you? He could be. It\\'s a big hospital. Aw, come on. If you\\'re really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys? Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles. Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives? I\\'m afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don\\'t want him to get a lobotomy, do you? Hmmmm, lobotomy... That\\'s all right, son. Well, there\\'s probably a down-size I don\\'t see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man. Hey Mom, Dad\\'s in a mental institution. Oh my God! Mother was right. Now Homer, don\\'t you worry. Your family\\'s gonna be here before you know it. Forget it, pal, there\\'s only one way out of here and it ain\\'t pretty. What\\'s that? Dating a nurse. I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house. No, mom, you said poor house. I said crazy house! Poor house. Crazy house! Poor house. Crazy house! Hello, you\\'ve reached the New Bedlam \"Wrongly Committed\" Hotline. All of our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line. What\\'s wrong, Homer? This place is so strange. Mike, I\\'m ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I\\'m... scared. We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you. HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I\\'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU\\'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME. Pancakes... football... Boobies... Bubbles, it\\'s gonna be a long night. I WISH YOU LOVE AND GOOD WILL / I WISH YOU PEACE AND JOY / Please feel free to express yourselves. In these sessions we want you to feel relaxed and uninhibited. Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn\\'t leave the house. I just couldn\\'t. Was the door locked? No, I just couldn\\'t face what was out there. Was it raining? No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on. Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn\\'t make that long drive to work. Were you out of gas? Baby. Mrs. Simpson, I\\'m sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility. Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you\\'d see how sane he is. You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord! Mmm... pancakes. Oh, Mr. Simpson, you\\'ve got a visitor. Marge! Oh, Homie. Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you\\'re no threat to yourself or others. That\\'s the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please? Of course. Not insane. I\\'m proud of you, Homer. Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us. Well, how about today? I\\'m only here voluntarily. You are? Why? Well, back in 1979, I got real depressed when my \"Off the Wall\" album just got one lousy Grammy nomination. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. Joe\\'s Taxidermy. You snuff \\'em, we stuff \\'em. Boy, when I get home, I\\'m going to wrap my hands around your neck -- Homer, whatever they\\'ve got you on, cut the dose. Now listen. I\\'m bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn\\'t that cute -- he\\'s heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice. Um Homer, I\\'m a vegetarian. And I don\\'t drink. Are you sure you\\'re here voluntarily? Yes. Now Homer, please make sure he doesn\\'t tell anybody I\\'m coming. Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse. Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret? No. Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Aunt Bella! Wait a minute. I got a call on the other line. Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! We\\'ve just been handed a bulletin from our Rock \\'N\\' Rumor Department. That\\'s right, Michael Jackson -- the Thriller himself -- is moonwalkin\\' his way right here to our very own Spring- field! And while we go check it out, why don\\'t you enjoy our seldom heard, extra longggg version of \"In-a-Gadda-da-Vida.\" Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post? Aye carumba! This is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the uh Dalai Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby declare that Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway. And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital. Thanks everybody! It\\'s great to be sane. Here he is! Here\\'s the guy you wanna see. Huh? Huh? Huh? He\\'s three hundred pounds. He\\'s white. He\\'s dressed without flair. What the hell made me think Michael Jackson would even visit this jerkwater burg? You owe us Michael Jackson. Don\\'t ever show your face around here again, ya tool. Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I\\'m afraid to ask. You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask. I thought so. Oh, Bart, you... Come off. I\\'m sane now. Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show. Hey, Bart. Hey... you. I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE / Bart, when I was a kid, I didn\\'t have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters\\' birthdays rolled around? Stiffed \\'em? No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared. I can\\'t write a song. I\\'m only ten. Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records. Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient. You\\'d be amazed how often I hear that. Just leave me alone. Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he\\'s here with you willing to work on this song. It\\'s your choice. So long. Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I\\'ll boil some coffee. LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA. Uh, no. Bart, we\\'ve got to get to your real feelings about your sister. I don\\'t have any. Well, let\\'s go look at her. Maybe that will help. Ah, she looks sad. That\\'s cause she knows you\\'re looking at her. Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren\\'t. Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight? Well, your training wheels come off your bike. Good. That\\'s good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE. You\\'re just putting that in because it\\'s commercial. Lisa... Lisa... Lisa. Huh... wha-- Bart, it\\'s six a.m. That\\'s right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four -- LI-SA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / AND GOD BLESS YOU THIS DAY / YOU GAVE ME THE GIFT OF A LITTLE SISTER / AND I\\'M PROUD OF YOU TODAY... HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / AND YOUR FIRST KISS FROM A BOY... LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Yeah! Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael. Well, my work is done here. Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice? This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I\\'m a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin\\' good on this earth, so I kept on doin\\' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy? Not me. I got this. Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You\\'re a credit to Dementia! See ya! LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / GOD BLESS YOU THIS DAY / YOU GAVE-A ME THE GIFT-A DA DOO DA DEE DEE DOO DOO / AND I\\'M A PROUD OF YOU TODAY! LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... I WISH YOU LOVE AND GOOD WILL / I WISH YOU PEACE AND JOY / I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART\\'S DESIRE / AND YOUR FIRST KISS FROM A BOY... LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Take it away, Lis. LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Oooh! Stupid junk mail... \"You May Have Already Won!\" Yeah, win this... \"Here\\'s Good News for Homer Simpsoy\"... I\\'ll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am? Huh? A check? Mr. Simpson, I can assure you this \"check\" of yours is non-negotiable. Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure? You see where it says \"VOID-VOID-VOID\" and \"This Is Not A Check\"? \"Cash value one twentieth of a cent\"? \"Mr. Banker, do not honor.\" Shut up. I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal. I don\\'t think real checks have exclamation points. Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest. Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I\\'m not gonna start now. Hey, a cartoon. \"Well dear, you always wanted a compact.\" -- Ain\\'t it the truth. No, it is not the truth, Homer. It\\'s well documented that women are safer drivers than men. Oh, Marge. Cartoons don\\'t have any deep meaning. They\\'re just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh. Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin\\', it\\'s lunchtime. Nah, you go ahead. Hey, You don\\'t wanna eat? What\\'d ya do, get one of them stomach staples? As Tolstoy said in \"Quotable Notables,\" \"Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread.\" Who is that bookworm, Smithers? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate. We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in \"Preacher with a Shovel.\" But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear. Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds. You\\'ve certainly taken a shine to that magazine. Important. Ooh... How about the \"V\"? It\\'s not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket. Those kids don\\'t know what they\\'re missing. Daaad! Hey, what gives, man? We\\'re all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He\\'ll be killed! Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article. Don\\'t be so... Oh, you\\'re right. Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute... Hmph? I thought you might want to snuggle. That reminds me! \"Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage.\" Marge, you have a nice body. And if you\\'d like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask. Thank you, Homie. Wow, little meatloaf men! Where did you get the idea for this, Mom? Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free! It certainly has enriched our lives. Wow! \"Win a Trip to Washington D.C.\"! \"All expenses paid... VIP tour\"... Oh. It\\'s for kids. Wait, Dad! Hm. An essay contest. \"Children under twelve\"... \"Three hundred words\"... \"Fiercely pro-American.\" Sounds interesting. Bart, maybe this is something you\\'d like to do, too. Mom, it\\'s a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on. What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He\\'d say... oh, think of a better opening. How\\'s it going, honey? Not very well. Very. Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question -- Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I\\'d go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore? Yes! I don\\'t know, I thought maybe bikes weren\\'t cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, \"cool\"? Yes, Mom. Okay, America. Inspire me. Wow, a bald eagle. Hmm... Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad. Sweetheart, there\\'s nothing I wouldn\\'t do for that magazine. \"So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you\\'d better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car. Oh yes, and don\\'t forget to burn your house. Because none of those things could exist without six white stripes, seven red stripes, and a hell of a lotta stars.\" Thank you very much. YEAH! Damn right! Recipe for a free country: Mix one cup liberty with three teaspoons of justice. Add one informed electorate. Baste well with veto power... My back is spineless. My belly is yellow. I am the American Non-Voter... ... Stirring two cups of checks. Sprinkle liberally with balances... Ding. \"Dong.\" The sounds of the Liberty Bell. \"Ding.\" Freedom. \"Dong.\" Opportunity. \"Ding.\" Excellent schools. \"Dong.\" Quality hospitals... When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you. What do you think? It\\'s good. A little too good for an eight-year-old. Methinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy. Person. Mr. Simpson, I\\'d like to ask you a few questions about your daughter\\'s essay. Lisa, will you excuse us? Okay. We the purple? What the hell was that? Are you a professional writer? Uh-uh. Are you interested in politics or government? Are you interested in anything? Could you touch your nose for me? Lisa, after meeting your father, I\\'ve decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington! Woo hoo! Who would\\'ve guessed reading and writing would pay off? Yes, sir. Can I get you something? Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot\\'s wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I\\'ve got coming to me. I\\'ll see what I can do. Steward! Little boy, I bet you\\'d like to visit the cockpit. Oh baby! And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats? No thank you, I\\'d rather push this button. No. We\\'re all gonna die! Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi! Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS. BOOOOO! Oh, boo yourself! Here we are, kids! The Watergate. Hey! Uh... okay. Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow. Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies! Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Hey, I call first bedsies! Bart! There\\'s no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up. Well, okay, which one do you want? Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one. Really, you want that one? It\\'s all yours. Whatever you say. Why? What\\'s wrong with it? Nothing! Have a good night\\'s sleep, Lisa. No, really, what? Nothing. What did you do to it? Nothing. MOMMM! Stupid welcoming mint! Y\\'ello. Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Wake-up call? It\\'s two AM! Sorry fatso. Free food?! Lisa? I\\'m Faith Crowley, Patriotism Editor of Reading Digest. Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is \"How To Increase Your Word Power.\" That thing is really, really, really good. Well... good. Lisa, I\\'d like you to meet some of the other finalists. This is Truong Van Dinh and Maria Dominguez. Hello. Maria is the national spelling bee champion, and Truong has won both the Westinghouse Talent Search and the NFL Punt, Pass and Kick Competition. Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability? Sure, I guess. Ah, me too! These are special VIP badges. They\\'ll get you into places other tourists never see. Miss? What does the \"I\" stand for? Ah! What does the \"I\" stand for again? Ohh. \"On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to back-300 games.\" Yeah, right. Wow, the President\\'s bathroom! Do you mind?! Barbara Bush. Oh, you have those damn badges. Okay, this tub was installed in 1894... Mmmmmm... Money. Hey, watch it, chief! Folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. Oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don\\'t give out free samples. Lousy cheap country... BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis! Hey, what\\'s so funny? Oh Marge, grow up. Congressman, this is Springfield National Forest. Now basically, what we want to do is cut her down. Huh uh. As you can see in our artist\\'s rendition it\\'s full of old growth, just aging and festering away. In comes our logging company... to thin out the clutter. It\\'s all part of nature\\'s, y\\'know, cycle. Well Jerry, you\\'re a whale of a Lobbyist And I\\'d like to give you a logging permit. I would, but uh, this isn\\'t like burying toxic waste. People are gonna notice those trees are gone. Uh, Congressman... this is where it gets awkward, I... I never quite know how to put this... I just want to... ...Offer me a bribe? Ohhh... What is it? It\\'s that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay. Could be a good photo op. Uh, sure, fine. So, where do we... Not here. I\\'ve got a little place that I use for these uh... matters. Call me tonight. Well hi there! You must be Lisa Simpson. Hello, sir. Lisa, you\\'re a doer. And who knows, maybe some day you\\'ll be a congressman or a senator. We have quite a few women senators, you know. Only two. I checked. You\\'re a sharp one. Well, how about a few pictures? A tot shot always plays in the sticks. Ah, isn\\'t that nice. Now, there is a politician who cares. If I ever vote, it\\'ll be for him. Mom? Lisa, the contest isn\\'t for three hours. I\\'m too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial? Who\\'s that? An early crusader for women\\'s rights. She led the Floormop Rebellion of 1910. Later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece. Okay, but you don\\'t know what you\\'re missing. \"I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws.\" Amen, sister. I told you no one ever came here. So, Bob, where do we stand on Springfield Forest? Do I get my logging permit? Well, let me put it this way, Jerry... Tim-berrr! Ugh, what a pooch. Woof woof! How could I read my essay now? I don\\'t believe my own words. Honest Abe. He\\'ll show me the way. Mr. Lincoln, I... Mr. Lincoln, I need your advice. What can I do to make this a better country? Is this a good time to buy a house? I can\\'t get my boy to brush proper. Would I look good with a moustache? ...So I tries usin\\' turpentine, but that jes\\' made it worse... Mr. Lincoln, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. Mr. Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. I know your problem, the Lincoln Memorial was too crowded. Sorry, sir. It\\'s just that... No one ever comes to see me. I don\\'t blame them, I never did anything important. Just The Declaration of Independence, the Louisiana Purchase, the dumbwaiter... Uh, maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time. Wait! Please don\\'t go. I get so lonely. The truth must be told. Rudy my man, you\\'re a miracle worker. Your laundry, sir. There you go... buy yourself something nice. Thank you! Bart, are you ready to go to... I\\'ll room service you... Before you kill me, remember, this trip is \"All Expenses Paid.\" THE DEFICIT RAG / OH, YEAH, THE DEFICIT RAG / THOSE BUDGET GAPS CAN BE A TWELVE-DIGIT DRAG / I\\'M TELLIN\\' YA THAT\\'S THE DEFICIT / THEY REALLY MADE A MESS OF IT / THAT\\'S THE DEFICIT RA-A-G! Thank you! Oh, this guy is awful. I know, honey, but just sit still. Welcome, everyone to the awards luncheon. I\\'d like to introduce our distinguished judges who will select our scholarship winner. Former Redskins great, Alonzo Flowers... perennial third-party candidate, Wilson DeFarge...Senate page, Brad Fletcher... skin-care consultant, Rowena... and wealthy gadabout, Chilton Gaines. Our first essayist will be Lisa Simpson. ...Lisa?... Lisa? Oh, there she is. Lisa Simpson will now read her essay... I would like to read a different essay, if I may. \"The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. It stank then, and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air.\" Cool! A ruckus! \"And who did I see taking a bribe, but the \"Honorable\" Bob Arnold. But don\\'t worry, Congressman, I\\'m sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. And this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none.\" Senator, there\\'s a problem at the essay contest. Please son, I\\'m very busy. A little girl is losing faith in democracy. Good lord! Congressman, we want to drill for oil in Teddy Roosevelt\\'s head. Well... Teddy who? Congressman, you\\'re under arrest. You work fast. I work for Uncle Sam! We will now vote on the House Bill 1022, the expulsion of Bob Arnold. Mr. Speaker, I\\'m all for the bill, but shouldn\\'t we tack on a pay raise for ourselves? NO!! Okay, this should make my bosses very happy. Your bosses? Yep! All 250 million of them. \"When my family arrived in this country four months ago, we spoke no English and had no money in our pockets. Today, we own a nationwide chain of wheel balancing centers. Where else but in America, or possibly Canada, could our family find such opportunity? That\\'s why, whenever I see the stars and stripes, I\\'ll always be reminded of that wonderful word -- flag.\" There will be a brief recess while the judges tabulate their votes. Lisa, what\\'s gotten into you? Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin\\'. I\\'m sorry, Dad. I couldn\\'t think of a nice way to say America stinks. Extra! Extra! Feds nab rotten Rep! Gimme one of those! Imprisoned Congressman becomes born-again Christian. I can\\'t believe it! The system works. THE TRADING GAP SHUFFLE / WE\\'RE IN A HEAP-A TROUBLE / A-DOIN\\' THE TRADING GAP SHUFFLE! YES SIR! He already sang this song! No, that was about the budget gap. This is the trading gap. And now, the moment of truth: Will the winning essay be... \"Bubble On, O Melting Pot\"... \"Lift High Your Lamp, Green Lady\"... \"USA: A-O.K.\"... or \"Cesspool On The Potomac\"? Cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool... And now the winner is, \"USA: A-O.K.\" by Truong Van Dinh. Miss Crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. I would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. Particularly the courageous Lisa Simpson, whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Give her the check! I was serious. SAY, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT LISA S. / SHE\\'S THE LITTLE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD MUCKRAKER-ESS / SHE CAUGHT A CROOK AND REALLY MADE HIM PAY / SHE DID IT ALL IN JUST ONE DAY / THAT\\'S WHAT I WOULD CALL / BEING ON THE BALL! Ow! Bart! Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in. Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker\\'s just for the edges! You\\'re gonna be out here all day! I\\'m almost done. You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you\\'re finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We\\'re gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num! I\\'ll be there. Not-y not-y not. The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!. I think it means he\\'s having a barbecue. Well, why doesn\\'t he just say so? He\\'s trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance -- Oh, here we go again. Look, I don\\'t care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he\\'s a jerk. End of story. We can\\'t hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do -- Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place. Oh, Homer. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club... Fee fi fo fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simp-son! Mmmm- mmm! Hi, Ned. Homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of. We now return you to the exciting fifteenth round action at the Canadian Football League draft. And so the Saskatchewan Rough Riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, Jack, get the kicker they so sorely need... Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They\\'d cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders\\'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders\\' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I\\'d be laughing. Laughing from my grave. What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que. Hey, everyone, I\\'m back! Great to see ya! Nice seein\\' ya! Heya, Homer! Okay, thanks for comin\\'! You\\'re \"it\"! Electricity! No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag. Okay... Now you\\'re \"it\"! Hey, no tagbacks. Yeah, you cheater! You lie like a fly with a booger in its eye. The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake... Friends, we love you all, but I also have a \"sinister\" motive for asking you all here -- \"sinister\" being Latin for \"left-handed.\" But enough joking. That was a joke? As of Friday, I\\'m saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game. No, I kid you not. Here\\'s the noose I had to wear for ten years. What are you going to do, Ned? Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I\\'m left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain\\'t all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission. Well sir, I\\'m opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I\\'m gonna call it the Leftorium. So Homer, I\\'m dyin\\' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium? Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me. Well, I know it\\'s a little risky and it\\'s gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it\\'s gonna be a lot of fun, too. Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz? Oh, no. The Springfield Mall. Oh, here, you two. Make a wish. Nah. It\\'s fun. No, it isn\\'t. You must have something you want to wish for, Homer. Hmm, let\\'s see. Nah. Hmmm. Heyyyy. Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin\\'! Keep your pants on, Flanders! I\\'m wishing as fast as I can! Ooooh. Mmmm -- too far. Okay. Ready. Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I\\'ve got more chicken bone! What\\'d you wish for, Homer? No, no, no, don\\'t say. Otherwise it won\\'t come true. Oooh. That would be a shame. Wouldn\\'t it, Flanders? Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV? Six. Seven if there\\'s something good on. Don\\'t you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise? Yeah, but what are ya gonna do? Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It\\'s a boy\\'s best friend. That\\'s the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children\\'s parents should be ashamed of themselves. Hello, I am Akira. HA! That didn\\'t hurt very much because I know the ancient art of karate. Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence. People from all walks of life... doctors... Hii--ya! ... homemakers... Hoo--yea! ... landscape architects... Ugh--ya! ... choreographers... Haa! High karate at low, low prices. I cannot tell a lie, this is a great deal. HA! Hey Mom, how \\'bout if I learn karate? Will that we make you happy? That sounds fine, Bart. See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology. Well, if it isn\\'t the Leftorium. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Hey Flanders, how\\'s business? Oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up. I am so sorry. How much do I owe you? Now, you put that money away. That was an accident. Really? Well, thanks. Could you validate my parking? Absotively posilutely. So, Flanders, have you sold anything? N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop. Greetings. I am Akira, your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, the Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson: we learn karate so that we need never use it. Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks? Ah, yes, the impetuousness of youth! For now, let us read. Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads? First you must fill your head with wisdom. Then you can hit ice with it. Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom? You can, if you believe you can. Paying money to read books... the hell with this. Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death! I\\'m telling you, Flanders\\' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge? Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is? No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I\\'m dying to know. It\\'s the German term for \"shameful joy\" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others. Oh, come on, Lisa. I\\'m just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He\\'s usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What\\'s the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours? Sour grapes. Boy, those Germans have a word for everything. So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today? Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks. Uh, I learned the touch of death. Ooh, the touch of death. Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace. Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m! Bart, don\\'t use the touch of death on your sister. Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class. You missed a spot. All right. Comin\\' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady. Hey, boy. How was class? Today we learned how to rip a man\\'s heart out and show it to him before he dies. Oh, that\\'ll learn \\'im. What\\'d ya swipe? An \"I Love Lefties\" shot glass. Left-handed pinking shears. Pinking shears? Let\\'s go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes. Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours? Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin\\' to spread. Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase. Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain. Just stamp the ticket. Uh, okay. Hey Homer, how\\'s your neighbor\\'s store doing? Lousy. He just sits there all day. He\\'d have a great job if he didn\\'t own the place. Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell? Uh, well actually, Moe... I dunno. Hey, Lis. Change the channel. You change it. Okay, okay. I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back. But Bart -- Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You\\'re that first apple I didn\\'t want. That sinks it. I\\'m really gonna let \\'em have it this time! Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns\\' desk. Chop, chop! Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what\\'s your name? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? Hmm hmmm. I\\'m Monty Burns. Hm. \"Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He\\'s distracting the female employees.\" Smithers... Got me, sir. Oh! It\\'s a real one! \"No more apples in the vending machine, please.\" Well, that\\'s almost a sentence! Can I leave, Mr. Burns? Oh, of course. And don\\'t worry, there\\'ll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples. But the note was asking you to -- Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She\\'ll make everything all right, I promise. Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener! Um, Mr. Burns... Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I\\'m dyin\\' out here. Sorry, Flanders. Huh? Are you sure you\\'re not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price. Sorry, Ned. Hey, I\\'m flexible! You don\\'t have to pay all at once. I\\'ll be here all night if you change your mind. Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I\\'d just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like? Oh, I get it. It\\'s not good enough for you, but it\\'s good enough for me! Well, I wouldn\\'t be caught dead buying this... Hello! Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She\\'s a butane beaut. I\\'ll give you twenty bucks for it. Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year. You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it. Oh, Homer, be reasonable. Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye! All right, Homer. Twenty dollars? Twenty dollars. Now I don\\'t want it. What? I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest. Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney? Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly. Daddly-doodly. Homer, this is the Flanders\\' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this? Only seventy-five beans! Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate! I\\'m sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery. Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch. Good afternoon, sir, I\\'m Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I\\'m here to ask you why you don\\'t think you need to pay your bills. Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there\\'s just so many. Does it make you feel good about yourself to owe people money? We\\'ve been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders. I know, but... Wait a minute. I\\'m Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there. Oh. Flanders is in debt? Are you sure? We don\\'t make mistakes. Damn right-handed ledgers... can\\'t write in these things... Uh, there\\'s a store where... Hey, you said you\\'re Homer Simpson? Yeah. See you on Thursday. Knock \\'em dead, boy! Kid\\'s gonna be a black belt in no time. Hey, check out the saxophone! Pretty boss, but there\\'s something stuck on it. Hey!! Hey, look at me -- I\\'m Elvis, man. You give that back. That belongs to me! That\\'s mine! If you want it, just take it. Okay. We\\'re sorry. This time we\\'re really gonna give it to you. Hey, stop that. Hey Lis, something wrong? Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate. Uh oh. Oh, we\\'re real scared. Please don\\'t hurt us, Bart! What are you gonna do, throw your diapers at us? Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there. I think they\\'ve learned their lesson already, Lis. No, we want to see the touch of death. Yeah, come on Karate kid. Waste me! It\\'s funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right. Homer! Over here! Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back. Well, there\\'s no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up. You\\'re gonna live in your car? Oh, oh, no, it\\'s just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister\\'s apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city! Yay! Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You\\'re head of the car till I get back. Okay, Dad. GRAY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE / BRUSH OFF THE CLOUDS AND CHEER UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE / TAKE OFF THE GLOOMY MASK OF TRAGEDY / IT\\'S NOT YOUR STYLE / YOU\\'LL LOOK SO GOOD THAT YOU\\'LL BE GLAD YOU DECIDED TO SMILE / TAKE OUT A PLEASANT OUTLOOK / STICK OUT THAT NOBLE CHIN / WIPE OUT THAT FULL OF DOUBT LOOK / PUT ON A HAPPY GRIN / AND SPREAD SUNSHINE / ALL OVER THE PLACE / JUST PUT ON A HAPPY FACE. Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I\\'m ruined. I know! You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can\\'t help me now. Why not? I sold it to you for seven cents. Oh. You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing\\'s gone right. It\\'s like there\\'s been a-a curse on me. Oh, it\\'s all my fault. No it\\'s not. Yes it is. No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family\\'s future on some pig in a poke... I didn\\'t listen. Homer, you were a true friend. No, I was a swine. Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store? For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did. Flanders, you open that store tomorrow! Oh, Homer, there\\'s no point... I SAID DO IT! Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me. A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby! \"Kiss Me, I\\'m Left-Handed\"? That\\'s a classic! Whoa! Homer Simpson\\'s on the phone. Tell him I went out. He needs you to help Ned Flanders. Ned Flanders is in trouble!? Smithers, I\\'m licked. You open this can. Okay, but you softened it up for me, sir. Hold it, Smithers! I\\'ll open the can! But sir, how? To the mall! I\\'ll explain on the way! Hurry, Neddie, hurry! Oh golly, it\\'s a miracle! C\\'mon, you lefties. What\\'d I tell you? Homer? It\\'s all here, and it\\'s all backwards. That\\'s right. The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns! My life begins today! Wow! What an icebreaker! Left-handed ledgers! Now I can write all the way to the edge! Ah ha ha... left-handed Nunchuks. Wow. The boys at the Diners Club will think I\\'ve gone quite mad. Oh, and I\\'ll have that roadster in the corner as well. Yes, sir! Huzzah for the shopkeep! Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends. To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town. Everybody! GREY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP / STICK OUT THAT NOBLE CHIN / WIPE OFF THAT FULL OF DOUBT LOOK / SLAP ON A HAPPY GRIN / AND SPREAD SUNSHINE ALL OVER THE PLACE / JUST PUT ON A HAPPY FACE! Good mornin\\' world! Ow! Good morning Lisa! What are you so happy about? Why shouldn\\'t I be happy? It\\'s a beautiful day, my homework is done, I\\'ve got my mojo workin\\' and we\\'re goin\\' on a field trip this afternoon. And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge. Hey! It\\'s not in here. You stole it! No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart. Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up! Hey, that\\'s my badge, Homer. That\\'s Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh. ... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing... You ate my homework? I didn\\'t know dogs really did that. Wait! Wait! Bart Simpson! You\\'re late! Go fill out a tardy slip. But I\\'m only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That\\'s pretty damn late. Hey girls! Look at me! You can stop lookin\\' at me now. Well, it\\'s nearly one o\\'clock. And you know what that means. My glasses. That\\'s right. It\\'s time for our field trip to the chocolate factory. I trust you all remembered to bring your permission slips. What a day. I\\'m gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate. I\\'m gonna eat chocolate till I barf. Don\\'t worry, Bart, we\\'ll find something fun for you to do. Ah! Here we are! Here\\'s a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA. You\\'re making me lick envelopes? Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it. What kind of game? Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record. Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me. Yes... well... get started. Oh my God. It\\'s Cocoa Beanie himself. I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it\\'s the only way he\\'ll learn. Welcome to the chocolate factory. I\\'m Troy McClure. You probably remember me from such films as \"The Revenge of Abe Lincoln\" and \"The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West.\" The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs. In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package, chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf. And instead of being pure chocolate like we have today, it was mixed with shredded tobacco. And they didn\\'t eat it. They smoked it. You didn\\'t believe me when I said it would be fun, did you? No thir. Please, kids, play sanitary. Tan Die Doe Dow? What? Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow. Hmm... Well there\\'s still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don\\'t you tell your teacher I let you go home early. Die don\\'t. What next? Uh-oh. Hey, what\\'s with the kid? Hands off the material! Whaddaya know! The kid\\'s tough. He\\'s got spunk. I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs. Third race. Make it a good one. Eat my shorts. Eat my shorts. Ah, okay. Let\\'s see... Heyy... Wait a minute, you little punk! Eat My Shorts is in the fifth race. I said the third race! Don\\'t have a cow. Hmm... \"Don\\'t have a cow\" in the third. Put a deuce on him. While we are waiting to see how lucky you are, let me show you around. This is our bar, and over there is our slot machine and card tables.... Cool! Hey Boss! Here\\'s the call for the third race. ...As they come out of the turn it\\'s \"Sufferin Succotash\" by a neck over \"Yabbadabbadoo.\" Two lengths back to \"Ain\\'t I a Stinker\" and \"That\\'s All Folks.\" \"I Yam What I Yam\" can see them all. But here comes \"Donhavacow\" flyin\\' on the outside. And at the wire it\\'s all \"Donhavacow!\" Hey, I like this kid. I can\\'t believe we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks? I don\\'t know. I\\'ll have a Manhattan. Make Legs a Manhattan. I\\'m not sure I... Well? Supoib. You got a job? Doing what? Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin\\' cigars... you know -- a job. Bart, your father and I don\\'t want you doing that. Homer, say something. How much does it pay? Thirty bucks a week. Pfft. I make more than that. I was lookin\\' for those. Thanks, doll. It\\'s funny because it\\'s true. Well obsoived. Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence. Baloney. I\\'m not gonna rest until one of us is behind bars -- You! You wouldn\\'t happen to know anything about a cigarette truck that got hijacked on route 401? What\\'s a truck? Don\\'t play dumb with me! Relax Chief, you seem tense. You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan. Ah... I\\'m still gonna put you away, you know. Good for you, Chief. ... Bart! Have you started smoking? No. Don\\'t lie to me boy. Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought. They\\'re not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full. Yeah, right. Son... I\\'m gonna teach you a lesson. I\\'m going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you\\'ll learn... Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods. Right in here my man. Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated. Son, I\\'ll never doubt you again. The contents of the hijacked truck: some twelve thousand cartons of Laramie 100\\'s. Homer? Homer! We have... uh... Please, we have a number of leads. And let me assure all you smokers out there... there is no shortage of cigarettes. How do we know that? All right, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, of Laramie Tobacco Products. Jack? Thank you Chief. Folks, I\\'m pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading towards Springfield. And the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks. The police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster William \"Fat Tony\" Williams. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer? Bart, is your boss a crook? I don\\'t think so. Although it would explain an awful lot. Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us. Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks? Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family? No. Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them? Uh-uh. And what if your family don\\'t like bread, they like cigarettes? I guess that\\'s okay. Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart? Hell no! Enjoy your gift. Supoib. THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT\\'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA. I know it\\'s good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I\\'m not sure about the people Bart\\'s working for. I thinks they\\'re criminals. The kiss of death. That\\'s all I need! A job\\'s a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal. Well, Bart\\'s been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks. How long does it take to deliver a pizza? Looks like our cover\\'s blown. Let\\'s roll. See? It was all your imagination. Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie? Oh, all right. Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read \\'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes. Beats me. I was bluffin\\'. You win again, Homer. I am thrilled you\\'ve decided to let your boy continue to work here. You know if you need a hat check girl, I\\'ve got a daughter. Homer, you\\'re a hellava father. Homer, what did you find out? Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding. More \"stink lines\" boys. What\\'s this? What are you boys doing? You ain\\'t seen nothin\\'. Now beat it. So, Fat Tony. You invite me and my associates to your club with the promise of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield. Now you say your bartender isn\\'t here? I don\\'t know what happened. He\\'s never late. Louie! Make up some Manhattans. But I only know how to make wine spritzers. Now! What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan? Come on, boys. Lousy Skinner. You are late for work. Of course I\\'m late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school? This guy Skinner causing you trouble? He sure is, Patrone. Hm... perhaps we should go to meet and greet this individual. Come on, boys. Some large men to see you, sir. I don\\'t have an appointment with any large men -- You Skinner? I\\'m PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors? Children, I don\\'t know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING! Uh-oh. I thought I found him but it was only a cat. Now please... Please, please, I can assure you we\\'ll be using the most advanced, scientific techniques in the field of... body finding. I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy.... Please, Princess Opal, if we could just stick to Principal Skinner. Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits. Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming the English Channel. Really? Willie Nelson? He loved fire drills. Will ya get a hold of yourself, Lass, for the wee bairns! Hey look at me! I\\'m Skinner\\'s body! That is not funny, Lewis. Well, I heard Skinner\\'s buried under his parking spot. I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us at lunch. I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters. That\\'s not true! It\\'s just a rumor! You\\'re engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can\\'t prove anything. You killed me Bart. You killed me, Bart! You k-killed me, Bart! Reverend Lovejoy! You\\'ve... you\\'ve come to comfort me? Yes, Bart. ... There there... there there... Kill my boy! Kill my boy! You\\'re eight hours early for work. I like that. Did you kill my principal? Uh... Chinese guy with a mustache? No! My principal! That Skinner guy? Naw, we didn\\'t kill him. Nobody move! You\\'re all under arrest for the murder of Seymour Skinner. What\\'s a murder? Don\\'t play dumb with me. Cuff \\'em, boys. Oh, Bart. Why couldn\\'t you have gotten a paper route like other boys. Wait till I get you home, boy. What\\'s that guy doing here? Lionel Hutz, court-appointed attorney. I\\'ll be defending you on the charge of -- Murder one?! Wow, even if I lose I\\'ll be famous! That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years. Yeah, you\\'re right. Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult. I didn\\'t order this Skinner guy killed. But aren\\'t you the head of this gang? No, I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper. Then who is the Kingpin... the Capo de tuti Capi? That\\'s the guy. Hey! Forgive me, Don Bartholomew. We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn\\'t quit. It was like he went crazy. Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers. The kid liked to wet his beak in everything. Mr. Simpson, you\\'ve been the boy\\'s father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate? Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it\\'s true, it\\'s true! All the pieces fit. In light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your father, your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters, this court has no choice but to... Stop! Principal Skinner! I thought he was dead. I suppose you\\'re all wondering where I\\'ve been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when... I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said. We really think there\\'s promise in the boy. Get out! Okay, okay, you don\\'t have to yell. To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently. Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple. For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother\\'s delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home. Find anything this time, boys? Nah... no sign of him, chief. Princess Opal? I see nothing here but I\\'m afraid it\\'s splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad. But they seemed so happy. I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn\\'t hear me. I\\'M IN HERE!!! Well, let\\'s go. Okay, Chief. Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself. I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges. The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord. I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom. And that\\'s my courageous story. Your Honor, the prosecution moves that Principal Skinner\\'s testimony be stricken from the record. Denied. Case dismissed. Your Honor, do I still get paid? Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings. Get bent. I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think you\\'ve got a big future in racketeering and extortion. Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn\\'t pay. Blood on the Blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story. Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV\\'s Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson. Bart, I\\'m scared. Let\\'s get outta here. Shaddup! Where do you want it, Skinner? Not smart. Cool! Hey, when do we get the check for this? Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don\\'t have to pay us. You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers. Here\\'s good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate. Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King. Hey, this is the only paper in America that\\'s not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine. \"To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart.\" Bart, that\\'s so sweet. May I see the card? Hey there ten-year old. I couldn\\'t afford to get you a new drum... ...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww. C\\'mon, open it open it open it. Uh, maybe a little later, Bart. Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn\\'t let you have a party doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t get a present. We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse. I liked the balloons. I liked the party hats. What are you girls talkin\\' about? Nothing. Twins. Open your present. They\\'re official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I\\'ll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie. Milhouse, I\\'d like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring. What\\'s he talkin\\' about? Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isn\\'t that somethin\\'? Wow, brown! Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop. Oh, and by the way, I\\'d like to say thanks, and \\'applause, applause\\' to \\'birthday boy\\' Milhouse for his totally bitchin\\' party on Saturday. And uh, Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof. You did have a party. You didn\\'t invite me. And I thought we were best friends. Sorry, Bart. Bye little dudes. Don\\'t learn anything I wouldn\\'t learn. Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones. T.G.I.M., Sir. Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers? Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here\\'s the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped. Who the devil is Hercules? He\\'s my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He\\'s kind of tiny, so... you know, it\\'s a joke. Here\\'s a picture of Herkie. Well, Smithers, don\\'t you know how to paint the town red. May I ask how you spent your weekend? Well, a bit overly familiar, but I\\'ll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird. Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they\\'ll \\'oink\\' for more every time. What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. Sounds like my kind of flick. And how. Otto! Welcome! Apu! Hey, got a ba-ad case of the munchies, man. Time for a Heat-lamp Dog. Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there\\'s a small child inside your bus? Ooo, good thing you warned me. I was on my way to Mexico. Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire... Warning. Problem in sector 7-G. 7-G? Good God, who\\'s the safety inspector there? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Actually sir, he was hired under \"Project Bootstrap.\" Thank you, President Ford. Huh? Noise. Bad noise! Five minutes before critical mass. Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don\\'t panic. Whosever problem this is, I\\'m sure they know how to handle it. Huh? AHHH!! It\\'s my problem! We\\'re doomed!!! Sector 7-G is now being isolated. My best friend shafted me. I\\'ll never get over this, Otto-man. Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I\\'m sleeping on their couch. Margarita, I want you. Mr. Devereaux, I can\\'t work under these conditions. Have it your way baby. You\\'re fired. Oh, Avery. Call me Mr. Devereaux, will you. We interrupt Search for the Sun for this special news bulletin... Meltdown crisis: The first couple of minutes. K-B-B-L. Talk radio. Forget the hair, just give me the blush. Oh, we\\'re on. This station has just learned that a serious crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Oh my Lord! On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns? Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction. But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever -- -- things couldn\\'t be more ship-shape. Sir, where\\'s my radiation suit? How the hell should I know? Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown. Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus. Homie, please be all right. Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there\\'s a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT. Who\\'d have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated! Ninety seconds to core meltdown. Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir. Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward. Looks like this is the end. That\\'s all right. I couldn\\'t have led a richer life. After the meltdown we can expect roving bands of thieves to tie up traffic for ours. I don\\'t like this program. Change the channel. Wheel of Fortune! I don\\'t understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there\\'ll be a picture of me! Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I\\'ll try to be a better Christian. I don\\'t know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there\\'s a canned food drive I\\'ll give the poor something they\\'d actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix. One minute to core meltdown. Shut up! Simpson, it\\'s all up to you. It\\'s showtime! Okay, okay, think back to your training... Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer... Yes. Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button. Ooh, a side. Simpson? What? Do you see which button I\\'m pushing? Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no! Thirty seconds to core meltdown. Oh, Smithers, I guess there\\'s nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye! May I, sir? These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death. Good Lord. They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who\\'s laughing now? Fifteen seconds to core meltdown. Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe. All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day. Will I ever see you again? Sure, baby. Next meltdown. I\\'d like to solve the puzzle: \"Three loins in the fountain.\" Yes, we\\'ve isolated the problem and wouldn\\'t you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system. Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future. Excellent. Well, \"ta\". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell \\'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don\\'t be stingy with the vino. Yes sir. So, Smithers, it seems you\\'ve underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month. Milhouse, a little salt? Sure. Bart, my mom won\\'t let me be your friend anymore. That\\'s why you couldn\\'t come to the party. What\\'s she got against me? She says you\\'re a bad influence. Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother! But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance. Whatever she\\'s paying you, I\\'ll double it. I\\'m really sorry, Bart. Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you\\'ll recall, I\\'m the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company -- Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson\\'s my man! Hey, way to save our lives. Yeah, we owe you one. Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor\\'s a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button. Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me. Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what\\'s this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. Magic Johnson! Y\\'ello. Is this really Homer Simpson? Yeah. Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust. Well, thank you. Magic, if you play on that ankle, you\\'ll be in incredible pain. I don\\'t care. Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy\\'s a hero but he was really just lucky? Don\\'t worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are. Thanks, Magic. Bart, you\\'re not laughing. Too subtle? I\\'ll think about it, Marge. Nah. I\\'m just depressed. Milhouse\\'s mom won\\'t let me play with him any more. Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what\\'s all this? \"For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!\" Ohh, Homer! A role model in my very own home. How convenient. Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don\\'t need it here at home. How are you enjoying your ham, Homie? It tastes so bitter. It\\'s like ashes in my mouth! Hmm, it\\'s actually more of a honey glaze -- Maybe you ate a clove. What\\'s your problem, boy? I had a fight with Milhouse. That four-eyes with the big nose? You don\\'t need friends like that. How Zen. What? What is it? What are you doing? Looking at you with quiet awe. Well, as long as it\\'s quiet. Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don\\'t hate me. Please? Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he\\'ll never know who did it. Ah Simpson! There\\'s someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility. Huh? Wha?... It seems Ari\\'s been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville. They\\'ve lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve! Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what? Yeah. We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons. But I really can\\'t tell them anything, sir. Oh cut the false modesty, it\\'s getting tiresome. Besides, it\\'s your duty. Employee of the Month isn\\'t all ham and plaques. Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit. Couldn\\'t help it, sir. The parking here is terrible. This man has no love for his power plant. Begone from my sight. That one\\'s always been a problem. One... two... three... Community chest. Nah. Nah. Ah. I\\'ve won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks. Ha ha! You\\'re losing. Bart, don\\'t feed your sister hotels! Don\\'t worry mom, there\\'s tons of these things. I think that game is too old for her. Why don\\'t you go play with Milhouse? I don\\'t wanna play with Milhouse. You mean you still haven\\'t made up with him? It\\'s his mom. She says I\\'m a bad influence. C\\'mon Maggie, let\\'s go throw rocks at that hornet\\'s nest. Mrs. Van Houten, I\\'m Bart\\'s mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint. I remember. Please, come in. Marge, I\\'m sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn\\'t see your son. Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he\\'s like inside. He\\'s got a spark. It\\'s not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things... Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don\\'t say that word on TV! Well, I can\\'t defend everything he does. But let\\'s face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They\\'re too young for girls. And they\\'re a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they\\'re always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends! So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me! I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'m profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick. Oh, that\\'s sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too. Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk. Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk. Oh. What\\'s the matter, Homer? The depressin\\' effects of alcohol usually don\\'t kick in \\'til closing time. He\\'s just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on \"How To Keep Cool In A Crisis.\" What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody. Did it work? I\\'m a free man, ain\\'t I? Milhouse to Bart, do you want to come over and play? Uh, I don\\'t think so. Who cares?! Milhouse, I\\'ll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game\\'s over. Hey Mom, I\\'m friends with Milhouse again. Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.. What makes you think I did it? Who else would? You be good. I will. As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers, you are a pack of mangy cud-chewing ugly goats! Well, you\\'re in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson! Poor guy. Uh... ladies and... gentlemen... Just picture them in their underwear. Um, Grace under pressure is no... Three minutes to meltdown. Whew! Saved by the bell. Fifteen seconds to core meltdown. Just do what you did before. All right. Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe. Crisis has been averted. Everything is super. Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed? Sure. Moe. Eenie meenie minee moe / Is Homer a hero? / The answer is... no. I\\'m Kent Brockman and that was... My Two Cents. Now back to Scott Christian with Laugh and a Half. Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck in the news today when our own Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank hold-up without even trying. It seems the chief had come to the bank to cash in his penny jar. ...48, 49, 50. Good work, Chief. Just doing my job. Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own. Whoa! Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer! The Lakers have the ball. Magic Johnson\\'s coming down the floor on a fast break. Magic stops. His feet slip out from under him. The ball flies out of his hand, hits the referee in the head, goes in the basket! It\\'s a three point play. The Lakers win! Looks like I pulled a Homer. Our dad... now he belongs to the ages. I hold in my hand the final axe. Well, kids, that\\'s all the time we have for today. I\\'d like to thank Sideshow Mel, Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina, oh, and from \"Knots Landing\" Miss Donna Mills. Oh, she was a sport. WE\\'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN/ BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME... TO GO/ IF THIS OLD CLOWN WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED TOMORROW/ I\\'D BE IN HEAVEN STILL DOING THIS SHOW. See you some other time! Great show, Krusty! I really laughed when you... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where\\'s my nicotine gum? Ahh... that\\'s the stuff. Damn, I\\'m exhausted. Those kids were like ice out there. You\\'ve got a 4:30 Merchandising meeting. Cancel it. Therapist? Cancel it. Personal trainer? Cancel it. The opening line on the Giants is five and a half. Put a dime on it. Thank you dinner with Bart Simpson? I don\\'t know any Bart Simpson. Krusty, he\\'s the boy who saved you from jail. Well, we... made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won\\'t happen again. Well, there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart? Yes, sir? Thank you. Oh yeah. Cancel it. Hello? Mrs. Simpson, this is Lois Pennycandy, Krusty the Clown\\'s executive assistant. Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy. Read this. It\\'s Miss Pennycandy, I can assure you. I\\'m sorry to inform you that Krusty will once again not be joining Bart for dinner. Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he\\'s cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so? Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I\\'ve wasted my womanhood asking that same question. I apologize for him, something really important came up at the last minute. Lousy mildew. Eh, that\\'s good enough. Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye. Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for? A hundred. Consider it done. YOU\\'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU\\'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU\\'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG. THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG... Sweetie, I\\'m sorry, but Krusty isn\\'t coming to dinner again. Aw, man. Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge... ...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson. Ooh. Sex chat! You have reached the party line! In a moment you\\'ll be connected to a hot party with some of the world\\'s most beautiful women. Now, let\\'s join the party! Hello? Hello? Are, are there any women here? Hello? Are you a beautiful woman? Do I sound like a beautiful woman? This is not the sort of party as I had anticipated. Uh...ehhh... deeee... eeee... deeaar... Dear... Krust...\"y\"...? It says that the little boy who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you. Krusty, you are going to Bart Simpson\\'s house for dinner tonight. But I have plans. Hey, not the face. Why you, maddening, impossible man. If you don\\'t go tonight, I won\\'t be here tomorrow. Oh, alright. I\\'ll go. But I sure hate missing Schnapps Night at the Friars Club. Bart, wipe your feet. Why bother, they\\'ll just get dirty again. I\\'ve got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight. He is, for sure? Yes. God bless that clown. You think it\\'s him? Hi, kids! Hey, hey! Heh, heh, cute kid. Oh, hi Bart. I was just in the neighborhood. Why Krusty the Clown! What a surprise. Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade. Krusty, you don\\'t have to be \"on\" tonight. What are you talking about? Of course he does. No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics aren\\'t necessary here. Really? Yeah, just relax and be yourself. Ohh, that\\'s a relief. Go wait in the car. We could have seen a monkey. Who wants to say grace? Why don\\'t we let our guest do it? Bless us O lord... Hey! Krusty, would you do the honors? No! A clown is not a respected member of the community. Well, alright. I\\'m a little rusty, but um, I\\'ll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz. He\\'s talking funny talk. No, Dad, that\\'s Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish. A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here. Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks. Mel Brooks is Jewish? Krusty, are you alright? Yes, it\\'s just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. The old days... my... my father... Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what? Poor Krusty, he\\'s like a black velvet painting come to life. Krusty, why don\\'t you tell us what\\'s wrong? You\\'ll feel better. Yeah, spill your guts, man. Come on... Yeah, Krusty, tell us. Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn\\'t Krusty the Clown, it\\'s Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father\\'s father -- well, you get the idea. My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice. Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college? Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge. Rabbi, should I have another child? Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house. Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler? Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question? Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler? Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension. Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing. But papa, can\\'t... But nothing! You\\'ll do as I say or you\\'ll get such a zetz that you won\\'t even know what hit you. Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father. Boy, you don\\'t have to follow in my footsteps. Don\\'t worry, I don\\'t even like using the bathroom after you. Why you little... Krusty, please continue. Okay. My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use. What are you doing in that bathroom? Go away. Open the door this instant. Oy gevalt! Close the door! Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment. But the Lord works in mysterious ways. Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted \"The Most Likely to Hear God.\" Oh go on, Hymie. You\\'re exaggerating again. You\\'re so proud of your son. My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi. Hey, Funny-man! Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir! I have no son! You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown! And I haven\\'t seen my father since. That is so sad. Krusty, do you think about your father a lot? All the time. Except when I\\'m at the track. Then it\\'s all business. Look at you, Bart. Oh, isn\\'t that fun? Hey, whoa. Oh, the Fourth of July. I can\\'t believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart. Yeah, I\\'ve got a lot of fond memories. Well, look at the time. Almost midnight. Do you have any yearbooks? No, that\\'s it. You\\'ve seen everything. So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes? I want to go home. Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home. Gladly. Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh. Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad. Don\\'t worry about me, I\\'m a survivor. Hey, did I leave my keys inside? No! Oh, yeah. Here they are. Academy Award Playhouse now returns you to \"Hercules vs. The Martians.\" Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Oh great, we came all this way and it\\'s the wrong guy. I didn\\'t mean that literally. What\\'s this? I hear a phone ring and all of a sudden there\\'s nothing. I\\'m listening and there\\'s no talking. Hello. Mister, who are you? Why would they call ya if they don\\'t want to talk to ya. Didn\\'t Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn\\'t Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn\\'t that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to a commercial. Poor Krusty. A man who envies our family is a man who needs help. We\\'ve got to do something. Let\\'s move. Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi. Well, um... before you make any rash decisions, let me just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of today\\'s young Christians. No, no. We\\'re not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky. Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night. Really? I didn\\'t know that. Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week. Oh, oh, that radio show. Oh yeah, it\\'s all the kids talk about on Monday at school. Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. You\\'ll be the \"coolest\" kids on the playground. We\\'ll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi\\'s address? Oh sure thing. Let me just check my \"Non-Christian\" rolodex. I bet the rabbi misses Krusty. He\\'ll be so happy, he\\'ll be crying in his beard. Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky? Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends? We came to talk to you about your son. And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal. In that spirit, we bring you \"Gabbin\\' about God,\" sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: \"If we don\\'t got it, it ain\\'t holy.\" With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Okay, and our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights. Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists? No. Not for a second. Not at all. Great. Good conversation there. Our next call now is for the good Rabbi. Hello? Anybody there? I hear breathing but I don\\'t hear talking. What\\'s going on here? Hello, mister. Hello... hello. Some people got nothing to do but call people and hang up. There\\'s all kinds of meshugoyim in the world. Okay, let\\'s clear the board. Our next caller is a young boy from right here in Springfield. Hello, my name\\'s Dimitri. I\\'m a first time caller, long time listener. My question is, \"If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn\\'t the father forgive the son?\" I think so. Yes, of course. No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who\\'s in charge here? There\\'s nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please... Don\\'t worry, Lis. I\\'ve got a plan that can\\'t fail. Yiddle my man, you\\'re a genius. I love my work. Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know. But what if your example encourages others to give? Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don\\'t you think it\\'s time you forgave your son? Don\\'t you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher! Oy, this guy\\'s tough. Bart, we\\'re gonna have to out smart him. I don\\'t know, he\\'s pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise. What? Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist. He wants to have lunch with me? Ah ah, It\\'s a date! Izzy\\'s Deli, one o\\'clock, I\\'ll be there. The French government wants to give me The Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy\\'s Deli, one o\\'clock. Thank you, Monsieur President. Au revoir. Are you kids ready to order yet? Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles. Watch how fast I go. And for you sir? Oh, let\\'s see. I want a nice sandwich, but the Joey Bishop, ugh, too fatty... the Jackie Mason, I don\\'t know, sauerkraut makes me gassy. The Bruce Willis, I don\\'t even like his work... What is this?... Krusty the Clown!? That\\'s ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo... What? ... on white bread. Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite. Uh, could you direct me to President Francois Mitterrand\\'s table? You think you\\'re funny? Fifty million Frenchmen can\\'t be wrong. Bart, we\\'ve been going about this all wrong. What\\'s the one thing rabbis prize above everything else? Those stupid hats? No Bart. Knowledge. We\\'re gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica. Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!! This looks good Bart. Take it to him. You I told to go away. But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, \"A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right.\" Yes. Then doesn\\'t your religion command you to make up with Krusty? But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, \"Honor thy Father and thy Mother.\" End of story. Oh, it\\'s hopeless. Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar. At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar. But, my short learned friend, the Book of Joshua says, \"You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night.\" Is it not written in the Talmud, \"Who will bring redemption? The jesters.\" Sorry my friend, I\\'m still not convinced. And this is hardly the time or place to discuss it. Here you go, Bart. It\\'s a long shot, but, that\\'s all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew. Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew. No one could be / so gentle and so LOVEABLE / Oh mein papa / he always understood. I got somethin\\' in my eye. Here, take my hanky. Eeww! Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, \"The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I\\'ve heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it.\" End quote. Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel? Nope. It was Judah the Pious? Nope. Mamonides? Nope. Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls. I\\'m afraid not, Rabbi. It\\'s from \"Yes, I Can\" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son. The candy man? If a performer can think that way, maybe I\\'m completely upside-down on this whole problem. All the years of joy that I\\'ve lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways. There, there, Rabbi. It\\'s not too late. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, kids... Today\\'s show is gonna be the funniest, sidesplitin\\'est, cavalcade of... ah the hell with it. Roll the cartoon. Oh, yeah. My old friends, right next to my heart. Oy, such a filthy habit. Who asked you? Father? Son! Papa! Hershel. Daddy. Boychik! Oh, Daddy... You\\'re on, Krusty. Boys and girls, I\\'d like to be serious for a moment if I may. Spotlight, please. I just wanted... I just wanted... Come on guys. I\\'m not doing the spotlight bit. Let\\'s have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Lenny, a little reconciliation music if you please... Oh mein papa / to me he was so wonderful / Oh mein papa/ Come on, Dad / to me he was so good/ You know the words. We haven\\'t seen each other in twenty-five years. Oh, I love you, son. I love you too, Daddy. And, to conclude this Halloween newscast on a scary note, remember: The presidential primaries are only a few months away. Hey, if you don\\'t like it, go to Russia. Trick or treat, man. Hey, aren\\'t you a little old for this? You\\'re not even wearing costumes. Hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house back to the stone age. Here you go, kids. Lousy punks... We\\'re home! Get a good haul this year? Heh heh heh...Jackpot! I am very, very proud of you kids. We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster. I didn\\'t select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests... YAHHH! Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for... If you eat too much you\\'ll have nightmares. Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight. Oh yeah, three bad nightmares. I\\'d like to see that. What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this? Dad, that\\'s Monaco. I can do that but I don\\'t wanna. Eeuhgh. What is this thing? It is a monkey\\'s paw, dating back to Allal ben Abdallah. It has the power to grant wishes to its owner. Oh yeah? How much? Look everybody! My purse exploded! Sir, I must strongly advise you do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I myself was once President of Algeria... C\\'mom pal, I don\\'t wanna hear your life story. Paw me! Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing? Why at that little shop, right over... there. Oh no, wait, it was over there. You\\'ll be sorry. Flight seven, Marakesh to Springfield now boarding. Just a moment... Don\\'t shoot, Don\\'t shoot. They\\'re souvenirs. You must pay a fine of two American dollars. Okay. Let\\'s wish for x-ray specs that really work. No, Bart. Peace on Earth. X-ray specs. Peace on Earth. X-ray specs. Peace on Earth. X-ray specs. Peace on Earth. X-ray spects. Peace on Earth. Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish. Homer, there\\'s something I don\\'t like about that severed hand. Marge, don\\'t flake out on me. That monkey\\'s paw is gonna make our dreams come true. Oh, no! Maggie made a wish! Oh, my land! Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie. Ooh, a new pacifier. Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. Now you\\'re talkin\\'! Yaaayyy!! Woo hoo! C\\'mon, everybody. We\\'re going to the fanciest restaurant in town! I\\'m terribly sorry. I have absolutely nothing until June. Ah, the Simpsons! Right this way, please. Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren\\'t as bad as they say. If I hear one more thing about the Simpsons, I swear I\\'m going to scream. At first they were cute and funny, but now they\\'re just annoying. Eighteen bucks for this? What a rip-off! Man, this thing\\'s really gettin\\' outta hand. Oh, is there anything they won\\'t do? Oh Homer, this is awful. Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful. I wish for world peace. Lisa, that was very selfish of you. Sorry about the Falklands, old boy. Ah, forget it. We kind of knew they were yours. Won\\'t be needing these anymore. C\\'MON PEOPLE, NOW / SMILE ON YOUR BROTHER / EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER / TRY TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER RIGHT NOW... Foolish humans. Oh yes, Kodos. Earth is now ripe for the plucking. People of earth. We come to you in the spirit of hostility and menace. Now, let\\'s be reasonable. We can resolve our differences peacefully. Ow! Your superior intellect is no match for our puny weapons. Colonel! You\\'ve got to do something! What do you want me to do? I\\'m a baker now. I had a bad dream. Could I sleep in your bed? They\\'re konking us with a club. Wished we saved an A-bomb or two. Move along humans. This is all the Simpsons\\' fault. Before I was just bored with their antics and their merchandise. Now I wish they were dead. Jeez, now we\\'re slaves. This paw sucks. Ok, Ok. I\\'ll make a wish that can\\'t backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don\\'t want any zombie turkeys, I don\\'t want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don\\'t want any other weird surprises. You got it? Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey\\'s a little dry. The turkey\\'s a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?! Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things? Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that\\'s what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh. Okely-dokely. Ohh, would ya look at that? Kneel before my slingshot, puny earthling. Well, I guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens. Aarsh. He\\'s got a board with a nail in it! And save humanity will ya. RUN, KODOS! Well, Kang, it seems the Earthlings won. Did they?... That board with the nail in it may have defeated us. But the humans won\\'t stop there. They\\'ll make bigger boards and bigger nails. Soon, they will make a board with a nail so big it will destroy them all. Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I\\'ve saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol\\' homestead. I wish I had a Monkey\\'s Paw. Bart... Bart... Huh?... S\\'matter? No. I\\'ll give you a candy necklace. Climb aboard. Thanks, Bart. Less talk, more sleep. Presented for your consideration, Springfield, an average little town... with a not-so-average monster. Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... what a good day... happy thoughts... The people of Springfield have to make sure they think happy thoughts and say happy things, because this particular monster can read minds. And if displeased, can turn people into grotesque walking terrors. Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... Boy, I\\'m gettin\\' mighty sick of this. Ruff... ruff... ruff. Bow-wow! And did I mention that the monster is a 10 year old boy? Quite a twist, eh? Bet you didn\\'t see that one coming. Good morning. Morning. Good morning, dear. Hiya Bart!!! How\\'s my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh. Every day, same old cat. I\\'ll make him more interesting. Oh, there. That\\'s better. Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire! It\\'s good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It\\'s real good. Now hadn\\'t you better get ready for school? Okay. He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side. Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I\\'m driving. No can do, little buddy. See, there\\'s a rule that... oh wait... you\\'re the little dude with all the gnarly powers. Quit riding the brake, Otto. Give it some gas, man. Hey, this is fun, isn\\'t it? We\\'re going to die, aren\\'t we? Hi ya, Bart! Bart! Well class, the history of our country has been changed again, huh, to correspond with Bart\\'s answers on yesterday\\'s test. America was now discovered in 1942 by...\"Some Guy\"... And our country isn\\'t called \"America\" anymore, it\\'s \"Bonerland.\" Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one\\'s for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire.. Phone. Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... we love that boy. Moe\\'s Tavern. Hold on, I\\'ll check. ... Hey everybody! I\\'m a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt. That\\'s a new one . Now wait a minute... One... more... time! HELLO MA BABY... HELLO MA HONEY... HELLO MY RAGTIME GAL. DOUBLETIME, NOW. SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... I love school. Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please. I want to watch Krusty. Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks. The kick is up...it\\'s looking good... the ball is turning into a fat bald guy... ...and it\\'s no good. And you know what we say everytime something strange happens: \"It\\'s good that Bart did that. It\\'s very good....\" Well, we\\'re still on. Three hundred and forty-six consecutive hours. And all because of one little boy who... who won\\'t let me stop! Anyway... now let\\'s go over and see if Sideshow Mel has any more of those legal, over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his. Yayy! Slowly... slowly... don\\'t make a sound... don\\'t even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he\\'s least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh. That\\'s it, young man. You\\'re coming with me... Please? You like attention, don\\'t you Bart? Do I ever! Well we all do. The problem is that you don\\'t care whether you get good attention, for say getting good marks in school, or bad attention for .. say.. turning your father into a Jack-in-the-box. Homer, I see you agree with my theory. I\\'m not nodding. It\\'s the air conditioning. Well that\\'s too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him. Ouch! Good night, son. Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you. Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back. You got it. Oh, ah, thanks boy. I love you, dad. I love you, son. Yaahhh! Mom! Dad! My goodness, what\\'s wrong? We both had nightmares. Can we sleep with you? You both toilet-trained? Yes! Well, okay then... ... Four o\\'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work. Look at them, Smithers. Goldbrickers, lay-abouts, slug-a-beds... Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered. Oh, in the meantime, sir, may I suggest a random firing... just to throw the fear of God into them. Very well. Eeney, meany, miney... ugh, him. Attention Homer Simpson. Attention Homer Simpson. Wake up, Homer. Huh? What? You\\'re fired. For what? For sleeping on the job. How do you know I was sleeping? We\\'ve been watching you on the surveillance camera. Camera? Smithers, to the laboratory. You know Smithers, I\\'ve always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o\\' nine tails. How long till it\\'s up and running, sir? Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... The human brain. Hey, here\\'s a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor. How hard can it be? Hey, Dad. Here\\'s one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people. Ooo, what job is that? Grave digger. Deeper. Wider. Faster. I wouldn\\'t bury me turtle in that mud puddle. Ah, what\\'s the use? Sheesh. What a slave driver. What corpse should we unearth, sir? I don\\'t know. I feel like a kid in a candy store. Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering. Oh, will you quit your complaining. What a minute, sir. That\\'s Homer Simpson. He wasn\\'t exactly a model employee. Well, who is a model ... employee? Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir. Did you hear that, sir? No, I didn\\'t. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man? It\\'s the man in the bag, sir. I think he\\'s alive. Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied? Thank you, sir. Excellent. Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop. Ice cream scoop? Damn it, Smithers. This isn\\'t rocket science, it\\'s brain surgery. Hel-lo. Look at me, I\\'m Davey Crockett. Look, Smithers, a twitch... it\\'s moving. It\\'s alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who\\'s mad now?! Hi there. I\\'m your dad-dy. Mmm... sprinkles. Geraldo Rivera, Madonna and a diseased Yak. Mom, what\\'s wrong? It\\'s your father, he\\'s missing. Dad\\'s missing? Get outta here. He\\'s been gone for two days. Whayda ya know, she\\'s right. It wasn\\'t suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination. Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet. Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body. Oh, come on. It\\'s 11:45. Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right. Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive. Oh you\\'re right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke. And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that. Ahhh! Run, sir! Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I\\'m going to die. Sir, is there nothing I can do? Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether... Did you have a nightmare, Homie? No. Bart bit me. Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab. I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly. Perhaps you\\'re wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame. I didn\\'t wake up. It\\'s all a dream. It\\'s just a dream! Oh that\\'s right. It\\'s all a dream. Or is it? Next week on The Simpsons. Don\\'t forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner. Umm. Spaghetti. But Homer, tonight\\'s our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands. Oh, I hate having two heads. Oooh. Ahhh. Y\\'ello. Dad, I\\'m calling about the school talent show. Don\\'t worry, I know it\\'s tonight. Alto or tenor? No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one. Uh... isn\\'t this the kind of thing your mother\\'s better at? I called her. She\\'s not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement. Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed. Well, you\\'re in for a whale of a show tonight. I\\'d like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can\\'t sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet. Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer? Hurry, Moe, hurry! I\\'ve only got five minutes till the music store closes. Why don\\'t you go there first? Hey, do I tell you how to do your job? Sorry, Homer. You know, if you tip the glass, there won\\'t be so much foam on top. Sorry, Homer. This is a whole lotta nothin\\'. I\\'d rather be watching the boilers! Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I\\'m not kidding. Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare. What\\'s the matter, buddy? The moron next door closed early! I happen to be that moron. Oh, me and my trenchant mouth. Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year. Hmm. \"Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!\" Yes! That\\'s it! Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we\\'ve ever had. I really do. And now, here\\'s Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices. I\\'d like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner. Duh, look at me, I\\'m Principal Skinner. That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention. Hey, it\\'s Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she\\'s got for us today. Today\\'s special is refried dog poop. Please, you\\'ve got to open that store. Let me think about it... Eh... No. Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you\\'re disappointing. Well I don\\'t have one. Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car? Okay. Okay. But now we\\'re even. So what does your daughter need? I\\'ll have you know, I wrote it down. Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum! Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo! Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play? I dunno. Mom, where is he? If I don\\'t get that reed I\\'ll sound terrible. Don\\'t worry, honey, I\\'m sure your father is... Maybe. No. That\\'s a long shot. Bingo. Don\\'t worry, he\\'ll be here. Clarinet? No. Oboe? No. Saxophone? No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again? Saxophone? My ding-a-ling / My ding-a-ling / I want you to play with my ding-a-ling -- This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I\\'d like to put this filth behind us, and let\\'s all enjoy Lisa Simpson\\'s rendition of \"Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather.\" Haw haw! Haw haw. Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawnmower. Whew, I\\'d hate to be that kid\\'s father. Uh-oh. That\\'ll do. It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s the reed. Oh yes, of course. It\\'s the reed. Let\\'s hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax. Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah! Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache? I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh. I\\'m done. That cost eighty-eight dollars! I\\'m sorry dad, I don\\'t feel much like eating. Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn\\'t make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I forgive you. You didn\\'t mean that! No. I didn\\'t. Look Homer, Lisa\\'s taking her first steps. Yes. Da-da. Da-da. Did you hear that, Homer? No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive. Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her. Okay. Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie. Homie, you\\'ve got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she\\'ll forgive you. Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I\\'m gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let\\'s see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I\\'ll buy her that pony she\\'s always bugging me for. We can\\'t afford to buy a pony. Marge, with today\\'s gasoline prices, we can\\'t afford not to buy a pony. That\\'s ridiculous. Marge, I\\'ve got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa\\'s eyes, I don\\'t see love anymore. That\\'s no reason to buy a pony! See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes. Stick to the subject. Ha ha, you love me. Let\\'s be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You sound like you\\'re going to buy a pony. Promise me you won\\'t. Mm. What was that? Was that a yes or a no? Buh. Those aren\\'t even words! Sneh. Oh my, what is that smell? Oh, it\\'s you. Excuse me, do you sell ponies? Uh, sure pal, right here. \"Scot-tish deer-hound.\" Hey, this is a dog! My friend, you\\'re smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401. Merely take a left at the rendering plant. Now lady, I\\'m buying this pony for my little girl, and I don\\'t care what it costs. Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars. Half a million dollars?! He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby. Wow! His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania... I\\'ll take it! Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars? Uh, sure... let me write you a check. Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054. Is there a problem with that? Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash. Isn\\'t there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home? I sincerely hope not. I-I\\'d like to borrow five thousand dollars. Sorry, I can\\'t approve a loan that size myself. Hel-lo. Simpson, eh? How can I help you? Mr. Burns, you do this personally? It\\'s a hobby. I\\'m not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state\\'s stringent usury laws? U-su-ry? Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn\\'t exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan? I want to buy a pony. Isn\\'t that cute? Smithers, he\\'s planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn\\'t it? You\\'re not planning to eat it? No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn\\'t love me any more. Shut up, Simpson. Sorry. Do you have any collateral? Oh Smithers, let\\'s not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours. Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today. I didn\\'t do anything funny, sir. Shut up. Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony? Of course. Simpson, you\\'ve done it again. I love you, Dad! I am very upset with you. Sounds like someone\\'s angling for a pony of her own. Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony? Because she stopped loving me. I don\\'t love you either. So give me a moped. I know you love me. So you don\\'t get squat. Hee hee hee hee. Snowball II... Santa\\'s Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don\\'t exclude her because she\\'s different. Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse? I\\'ve got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage. Dad, no! That\\'s illegal. That\\'s for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me. Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable. Stable? That sounds expensive. This is what love costs a month? These are standard stable fees, Mr. Simpson. Plus, I\\'m teaching your daughter riding, grooming, and at no extra charge, pronunciation. Father, you\\'ve made me the happiest girl who ever lived. Oh nuts. What do I do? What do I do? Grampa, if you wanna go right... Yes... ... move your joystick to the left. Yes, move the... what\\'s a joystick? You didn\\'t tell me... Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it! Wait. Where\\'s the Hyperspace? Grampa, you\\'re the spaceship, not the... I\\'m the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh. Game\\'s over, Grampa. I got down on the floor for this? Wait, Dad, I\\'ve got something for you. I was hoping it\\'d be money. Hmm, oh dear, we\\'re in serious trouble here. We\\'re just going to have to cut down on luxuries. Well you know, we\\'re always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn\\'t even have. Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer. Nah, we\\'re not gonna be doing that. Then I\\'m afraid there\\'s no choice but to give up the pony back. First you didn\\'t want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind. Homer... Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays. All right. You got us into this, you get us out. Fine, I will. There\\'s plenty of money out there for a guy who\\'s willing to work for it. Do you have any jewelry you don\\'t need anymore? You\\'re so beautiful. Oh look. You haven\\'t touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick. Need money. Need money. One Scratch-for-Cash, please. Here you go. Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That\\'ll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu. Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer! Thank you. If I could just see the ticket... There it is. Please to be removing your thumb. No. Yes. Please, I must insist... No! No! I\\'ve got to look at the ticket No! You can\\'t see... come on! Yes, I must... No! Let go. You\\'re ripping it. A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery? Ohh... I need money. Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my \"Help Wanted\" sign. You\\'re looking for help? Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift. I\\'m your man! You\\'re hired. Woo-hoo! Always I dreamed the day would come when one of you would be working for me! She certainly tamed that horse. Yes, but what man can tame her? I won\\'t lie to you. On this job you will be shot at. Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor. ...Badge of honor. Here\\'s a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder. Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There\\'s only one bozo who comes in and buys them. But I eat... Oh. Heh heh, the perfect crime. Homer, where have you been? I was so worried. Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I\\'m not proud of and I don\\'t want the kids to hear it. Busted! I\\'ll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I\\'m off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy. Oh my God, she killed him. Mmm... salty. Homer, are you stealing Squishees? No sir. This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It\\'s called \"Wildfire.\" Come on, Apu honey, loosen up. I\\'m sorry, baby. While I am here pleasuring you, my store is going down the tubes. Three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents. Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products. Yes sir. Sorry baby, date\\'s over. Homie, how long do you plan to do this? I don\\'t know. How long do horses live? Thirty years? Mustn\\'t sleep. Must monitor core. Y\\'ello. I just called to say I love you, Dad. Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me? I just heard Millie Vanillie was just arrested for impersonating a McNugget. Well, it\\'s true. Well, it\\'s still fun to be up late. Hey, Homer, where ya goin\\'? Going for... eight hour walk. Homer sleep now. What\\'s wrong with Dad? He\\'s just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony? No. Well, it\\'s a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job. The poor guy. Where\\'s he working? The Kwik-E-Mart. Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can\\'t keep this up. You\\'re gonna make me give up Princess? Lisa, we can\\'t make you give up that pony. I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her. No, Bart. No one\\'s going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself. All the years I\\'ve lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face. Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today. Coming right up, sir. And fill it to the top this time. Yes, sir. She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you\\'re playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess. Although there is no change in my patrician facade, I can assure you my heart is breaking. I\\'ll never forget you. What--- wha, da, you call this melted cheese receptacle clean? Eh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave. Dad, you don\\'t have to do this. Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money... Dad, I understand the sacrifice you\\'ve made for me. That\\'s why I gave up the pony. You did? Hmmm hmmm. There\\'s a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse. Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus! I mean you, you dummy. Awww. Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it! Giddyup, Dad. He slept, he stole, he was rude to the customers... still, there goes the best damn employee a convenience store ever had. Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube... That baby changed our lives. Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody. Hi, Dr. Nick. Troy, I\\'ve brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe. Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore. Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you\\'ll think the body\\'s still warm. Oooooh! That\\'s one clean tombstone. Hey, Dad, you got a power drill? In the garage. Check. I\\'m offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five. Yeah, give us a break, Doctor. But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five. Hey, Homer, I can\\'t find the safety goggles for the power saw. If stuff starts flying, just turn your head. Oh, check. Okay. I\\'ll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five. Okay, okay, calm down. Homer, can you get the door? It\\'s my sisters. Homer, be nice. Okay, I will. I will. Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise. What do you know, he\\'s wearing pants. I owe you a lunch. Ugly... ugly... butch... What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you find a hair style you like? No... Hold the phone. That\\'s the one for me. Ed Asner? No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore. ... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah. Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Shh! They\\'ll hear you. Who\\'s using the power tools? I don\\'t know. Some guy I guess. Well, we\\'re going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I\\'m gone. Yes. How much? Everything. What\\'s the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you? Uh... take us to the video store. Anything for my little girl. Bart! You can\\'t weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid. Ooooooh, McBain. Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you\\'ll never make it to a pension. No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I\\'m two days away from retirement, my daughter\\'s graduating from college -- And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat. Yes, sir, everything\\'s gonna be just perf... Aw, damn, damn, damn. McBain... I\\'m not gonna make it. No, no, no. Just do one thing for me... Get... Mendoza. You want to rent it, sir? Why? I just saw the best part. But, Dad, I can\\'t find \"Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town\". Just grab something. All these movies are great. Look at this. \"Test your F.Q. -- Fatherhood Quotient\". Maybe you should try it on Homer. He\\'ll fail it. Uh-huh. In a second. I don\\'t know. Now Henry Winkler, there\\'s a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. \"I don\\'t always keep my cool like `The Fonz\\', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of \\'Happy Days\\'.\" ... They called him \"The Galloping Gazelle.\" His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski. Homie, we\\'re back. Don\\'t mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile. Homer, could you turn off the TV? There\\'s a little test I want you to take. Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman. This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father. Oh Marge. Question one: \"Name one of your child\\'s friends...\" Uh, let\\'s see, Bart\\'s friends... Well, there\\'s the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who\\'s always got his hands in his pockets. They want a name, Homer, not a vague description. Okay. Hank. Hank?! Hank who? Hank... Jones. Homer, you made that up. Question two: \"Who is your son\\'s hero?\" Steve McQueen. That\\'s your hero. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" Next. What are your son\\'s hobbies? Well, he\\'s always chewing on that phone cord. He hasn\\'t done that since he was two. Then he has no hobbies. Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see. Bart!... BART!!! What? You don\\'t have any hobbies, do you boy? No, not really. Well, that\\'s what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing? Building a Soap Box Derby racer. Oh, that\\'s a hobby! Hey, so it is. Oh, my God. I don\\'t know jack about my boy... I\\'m a bad father! You\\'re also fat. I\\'m also fat! National Fatherhood Institute. Please hold... AND THE CAT\\'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / LITTLE BOY BLUE AND THE MAN IN THE MOON / WHEN YOU COMIN\\' HOME DAD / I DON\\'T KNOW WHEN... National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking. I\\'m Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero. Wow, it really is you. Good Lord, a zero! Lona, cancel my one o\\'clock. Mr. Simpson, we\\'ll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately. Hey Bart, where\\'d you get the lumber? Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, \"Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine.\" A conventional design. Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ve booked some time at the wind tunnel. Goodbye, son. Hey Bart, I think they\\'re finally hauling your dad away. Maybe it\\'s for the best. For starters, Mr. Simpson, won\\'t you take this complimentary copy of \"Fatherhood\" by Bill Cosby. Ho, ho... if he\\'s as smart as he is funny, I\\'m sold. Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son. Well, that\\'s easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son? Why don\\'t you ask him yourself? Homer, meet Dave Jr. Huh? How\\'s your research coming, son? I think we\\'re near a breakthrough. Good work. Thanks, Dad. Oh, how I envy you! Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn\\'t happen over night. It took years of effort. I\\'ve never been afraid of a little hard work. Aw, that\\'s the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests? What boy? Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it. Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer. Aw, that would be perfect. Dear God! Not again. Bart!... I\\'m gonna help you build that racer. Thanks, but I\\'m almost done. Why don\\'t you get back on the couch and watch TV? Okay. No, I\\'m gonna do it. Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad\\'s help. But you can use me. I\\'m good. I\\'ve built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree. What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you. Come on Dad, it\\'d be weird. Oh this isn\\'t working at all. It\\'s hopeless... Wait a second. Hmm... \"Cosby\\'s first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite.\" Huh? Oh, that sounds too complicated. All right, I will! Son, I don\\'t think you should let me help you. Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes. Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons! You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit. I like our chances, son. Ugh. Your father is not supposed to help build your racer, but you should at least consult him about it. You\\'re in heat four. Whoa, where\\'s your helmet, son? Helmets are for wusses, Sir. I don\\'t think I can let you go without a safety helmet. This is my son and if he doesn\\'t want to wear one you can\\'t make him! Okay, fine. I want to get out of here sometime today. Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold! Aye carumba! Hey, you\\'re not supposed to smoke in the pit area. Fine. Hey, Simpson, where\\'s your loser-mobile? Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute! It\\'s over there, Nelson. Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap. You know, Bart, I don\\'t care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy. Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper. Help! Help! What was that? You didn\\'t hear nothin\\'. Are you nervous son? Don\\'t worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, \"Gravity is my co-pilot.\" Hey boss, just in case you need it. Thanks guys. Now get out of here. Oh my. I didn\\'t realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah! Aieee! Deploy, damn you, deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow! Young man, I\\'m afraid this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks. But that means I can\\'t possibly race! Son, you\\'re lucky to be alive. Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor. Is it okay to visit? Of course. Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death. Thanks, Bart. You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build \\'em like you. That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I\\'ll never race again. If you don\\'t race, then Nelson\\'ll win! Even if I wanted to, I\\'m in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car? Oh, I don\\'t know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else\\'s it\\'d kill him. On the other hand... I\\'ll do it. Okay Bart, we\\'ve got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I\\'m gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks... Dad... I don\\'t know how to say this, but I don\\'t want to drive your car. It\\'s slow, it\\'s ugly, it handles like a shopping cart... Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we\\'re Team Simpson. Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win. When did I ever teach you that? Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin\\'s car I can win. I\\'m sorry, but... Don\\'t be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad. I\\'ll just sit here in \"Li\\'l Lightnin\\'\" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son. Ow. Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert\\'s office? Why? What\\'s wrong? Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I\\'m being a little anal, but barefoot season\\'s coming up and there\\'s a world of rusty nails out there. Oh, sure, I\\'ll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you\\'ll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn\\'t it, Lisa? Martin, your bone is healing nicely. Tell me something I don\\'t know. Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker! Figure of speech. Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you... You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies. Dad, aren\\'t you coming? No! Now, don\\'t pout. I\\'m not pouting, you are. Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge. Sorry. Don\\'t you at least have something to say to Bart? No. Can\\'t think of a thing. Homer! I\\'ve always said you were a good father. I\\'ve always defended you when people put you down. That\\'s for sure. She ain\\'t lyin\\'. But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father. Leave me alone. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression -- The Soapbox Derby. In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns. Name your son\\'s hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... \"Name your child\\'s friends.\" Martin... Martin! I\\'ll curse that name \\'til the day I die... Huh? \"Who is your son\\'s heroe?\"... Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck! Wow, I\\'m one question away from being a perfect father. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" Hey ho Simpson. Shut up Flanders. Flanders! Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating? Well sir, there are two schools of thought... Great, thanks. I talked to Flanders about parenting. I\\'m a perfect father. Hold on, son, I\\'m-a coming! My friend and I have a bet -- Are you Mary Tyler Moore? Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you? Kill spectators. What is the matter with you? It\\'s my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I\\'ve never seen him like that. Forget about your father. You\\'re driving for me now! Do it for your old man, boy! Simpson, prepare to die. Let\\'s rock. Ladies and gentlemen, to drop the checkered flag, our beloved Mayor, Diamond Joe Quimby. To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor. Check out the rack on the blonde in the fourth row. ... like the arrogant Roman and Judah Ben Hur, these modern charioteers battle ferociously. No quarter given, none asked. The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field. And now, to present the trophy, three time Soapbox Derby Champion, Ronnie Beck. Congratulations Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories. Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad. I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast. The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive. Thanks, Nelson, put her there. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner. Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! That\\'s my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Hello, I\\'m Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield. Wow, infotainment. Tonight, we solute the silver anniversary of the great Springfield tire yard fire. Twenty-five years and stilll burning strong. ...We watch Springfield\\'s oldest man meet Springfield\\'s fattest man... He\\'s not so fat. And we visit with Heavyweight Champion, Drederick Tatum, who reminisces about growing up in Springfield. That town is a dump. If you ever see me back there, you know I really up bad. But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at... the bikini! Whoa, T and A. Bart, why are you still up? Lisa\\'s slumber party. Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? Boy, they\\'ve got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego. Lisa, your brother is so gross! You should smell his room. Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes, that\\'s what your husband\\'s job will be. It\\'s a mop. My husband will be a janitor. That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career. It\\'s a dustpan. The wax never lies. Let\\'s play truth or dare. Truth or dare, truth or dare. I\\'ll take -- \"dare\". I dare you to -- kiss Lisa\\'s brother. Eeeeeewwwwww! What the... ? Aaahhh! Ptew!! Ptew!! I\\'m telling Mom and Dad. You\\'re telling who? Mom and Dad! Jinx! Now you can\\'t talk until somebody says your name! Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush! What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man. Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? Because I\\'m \"jinxed\" dammit! Ow! What was that for? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it\\'s the law. Heh, heh. There he is! Let\\'s give him a make-over. Run for it boy! Come here, Maggie. That\\'s it. I\\'m outta here. Hiya, Homer. What\\'s the matter, Moe? Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn\\'t for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine. Yeah, things are tough all over. Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself. Could I get a beer? Uh, yeah, sure. Oh sorry, I forgot we\\'re out of beer. Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the \"Love Tester\". You\\'re too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad. Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender\\'s School. Gin and... tonic? Do they mix? Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself... One night Marge\\'s beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation. ... and this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets. Sorry, Harv. As you can see, we never did get the hang of it. Aye carumba! As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink. Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? If you\\'re going for a beer, this is the last one. I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle. In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids\\' cough syrup. It passed the first test: I didn\\'t go blind. They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom. I don\\'t know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good. Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it? A \"Flaming Homer\". Okay, why don\\'t you make us up a couple of \"Flaming Homers\"? Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup? Uh, let me check the lost and found. What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye... Oh. Here we are. It\\'s not without its charm. Try lighting it on fire. Whoa! Homer, it\\'s like there\\'s a party in my mouth and everyone\\'s invited. Hey, your Love Tester\\'s busted. I want my nickel back. Hey, buddy. Have one on the house. Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it? Well, it\\'s called a \"Flaming... Moe! It\\'s called a \"Flaming Moe\"! That\\'s right, a \"Flaming Moe\". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That\\'s why it\\'s called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin\\' at, Homer? It\\'s a Flaming Moe I\\'m Moe. Hey, what\\'s this? A sneeze guard. Wow, it really works. I\\'ll be back. Moe, I haven\\'t seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it? Who can say? It\\'s probably a combination of things. Another pitcher of those amazing \"Flaming Moe\\'s\". Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink. Barkeep, I couldn\\'t help noticing your sign. The one that says, \"Bartenders Do It \\'Til You Barf\"? No, above that store-bought drollery. Oh great! Why don\\'t we fill out an application? I\\'ll need your name, measurements and turn ons.. You really expect me to tell you my measurements? You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun. what do you offer in the way of salary? Minimum wage and tips. Of course there are fringe benefits. Such as? An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe. I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot. I like your moxie, kid. You\\'re hired. You shan\\'t regret this. Methinks I shan\\'t. Pardon me, are you the genius behind the \"Flaming Moe\"? Why yes I -- I\\'m your man. Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for \"Tipsy McStagger\\'s Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium\". Oh yeah? Hey, what\\'s Mr. McStagger really like? Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He\\'s just a composite of other successful logos. Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick. Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I\\'ve got a proposition for you. Keep talkin\\'. We feel your \"Flaming Moe\" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe. No dice. The \"Flaming Moe\" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink? Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that. So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin. Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again you\\'ve wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? You\\'re next. \"The Inventor I Admire\", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He\\'s my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the \"Flaming Homer\"! The \"Flaming Homer\"? You mean the \"Flaming Moe\". And your dad didn\\'t invent it, ya wuss. Moe the bartender did. Yes, everyone knows that. It\\'s not true! My father invented that drink, and if you\\'ll allow me to demonstrate... Bart, are those liquor bottles? I brought enough for everybody. Take those to the teacher\\'s lounge. You can have what\\'s left at the end of the day. Good evening, Krusty. Nice to see you, Bernard. Thank you very much. Right this way. Krusty, over here! What the--? Henceforth, this date shall forever be known as \"Flaming Moe\\'s Day.\" Uh, sir, this is already Veteran\\'s Day. It can be two things! Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a \"Virgin Moe?\" Honey, what\\'s wrong? I\\'ll tell you what\\'s wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! Take that off this second! Okay. Homie, why don\\'t you just go down to Moe\\'s and talk to him? I bet he\\'d be willing to share some of his success with you. Can I help you sir? I need to talk to Moe. Your name\\'s not on the list. I didn\\'t even tell you my name. Okay, what\\'s your name? Homer Simpson. Not on the list. But-- We\\'re all filled up. Fire laws. Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get \\'em to come up here. How about a warm \"Flaming Moe\\'s\" welcome for Aerosmith! I don\\'t think so, Moe. / Yeah, we\\'re just hangin\\' out. C\\'mon, guys. Free pickled eggs. Hello, St. Lewis! Uh, that\\'s Springfield, Steven. Uh, yeah, right. Are you ready to rock?! Yeah!!! I said, are you ready to rock?! Yeah!!! Hit it!! WELL THERE\\'S A BACK SEAT LOVER, THAT\\'S ALWAYS UNDER COVER, AND I TALK TO MY DAD, HE SAY/ HE SAID, YOU AIN\\'T SEEN NOTHIN\\' TILL YOU\\'RE DOWN ON A MUFFIN AND YOU\\'RE SURE TO BE CHANGIN\\' YOUR WAYS/ I MET A CHEERLEADER WAS A REAL YOUNG BLEEDER OH THE TIMES I COULD REMINISCE/ TO THE BEST THINGS OF LOVIN\\' WITH HER SISTER AND HER COUSIN AND THEY STARTED WITH A LITTLE KISS/ Barney? Hey, Homer. I want you to meet my friends, Armando and Raffi. Hey, Moe, get up here! Walk this way. Walk this way. Walk this way. Hiya, Scrumptious. Do you want to ignite my drink? You\\'re my kid\\'s teacher! Single parent, are we? No! Well, let\\'s pretend you are. Get away from me. Hey, Moe? Oh, hiya, Homer. How \\'bout a beer? I\\'d rather have a \"Flaming Homer\". A what? Oh, I get it. How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it. If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise. Morris, is what this man\\'s saying true? Well, it\\'s hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it. Whoop, telephone. Flaming Moe\\'s. Uh, yes, I\\'m looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh. Hold on. I\\'ll check. Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men\\'s room for a Hugh Jass. Oh, I\\'m Hugh Jass. Telephone. Hello, this is Hugh Jass. Uh... hi. Who\\'s this? Bart Simpson. What can I do for you, Bart? Uh, look. I\\'ll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I\\'d like to bail out right now. All right. Better luck next time. What a nice young man. Homer, I\\'m sorry you\\'re mad at me, but this isn\\'t personal. This is business. Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer! What? I\\'m sorry. Homer, I couldn\\'t hear you. I said, you just lost yourself a customer! What? You just lost yourself a customer. Homer, you\\'re gonna have to speak up! You just lost yourself a customer, Moe! I lost myself to what? You just lost yourself a customer. Homer, I\\'ll talk to you tomorrow. You just lost yourself a customer. Yeah, you can use it! WHEN THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD HAS GOT YOU DOWN/ AND YOU WANT TO END YOUR LIFE/ BILLS TO PAY, A DEAD-END JOB/ and PROBLEMS WITH THE WIFE/ BUT DON\\'T THROW IN THE TOWEL/ \\'CAUSE THERE\\'S A PLACE RIGHT DOWN THE BLOCK/ WHERE YOU CAN DRINK YOUR MISERY AWAY/ AT FLAM-ING MOE\\'S/ LET\\'S ALL GO TO FLAMING MOE\\'S/ LET\\'S ALL GO TO FLAMING MOE\\'S/ WHEN LIQUOR IN A MUG/ CAN WARM YOU LIKE A HUG/ AND HAPPINESS IS JUST A FLAMING MOE AWAY/ HAPPINESS IS JUST A FLAMING MOE AWAY. Barney! How\\'s the world treatin\\' you, Mr. Gumble? Hey, there. What can I do for ya, Harv? Well sir, Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink. He\\'s here?! Oh, no, no. I mean my company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe. We\\'re prepared to offer you one million dollars. Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before, it ain\\'t for sale. Don\\'t be stupid. We have a laboratory for this kind of thing. We\\'ve got it all figured out except for one ingredient. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph... the secret ingredient is... love? Who\\'s been screwing with this thing? I\\'m sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me. Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here. I got hooked on this stuff in the service. Ah, my new watering hole. Yeah, what do you want?! A beer? Okay, then. Can I have a clean glass? Here you go, your majesty. Next up, a toast to the wizard of Walnut Street. The Flaming Moe dates back to my forefathers who were bartenders to the Czar. So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case? I\\'m sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but you can\\'t copyright a drink. Well, this all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of \\'78. How about that? I looked something up! These books behind me don\\'t just make the office look good, they\\'re filled with useful legal tidbits just like that! Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed... Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. Oooh! Look at me, I\\'m making people happy. I\\'m the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Well, duh. Now that\\'s what I call a \"Happy Hour\". Morris something troubles me. Don\\'t worry baby, my mother won\\'t be home for another twenty minutes. No, I was just thinking about Homer Simpson. That\\'s okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning. I meant I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer. But honey -- He\\'s your friend, Morris. And you took advantage of him. Alright, alright. I\\'ll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas. Moe... Moe... Moe... Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today? Okay, but you promised me moe money. I moe, I moe. Moe... Moe... Moe. When Bart\\'s done, can we moe to the moevies? There\\'s a moetinee. Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe. Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe... Hey, Homer. Whatsamatter? Hey, where\\'s Joey? Mrs. Krabappel, I really need my drum sticks. Come and get \\'em. You\\'re gonna be a rich man, Moe. I gotta tell you, the way we usually work in these situations is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business. C\\'est la vie. What the... Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe\\'s. All the time wondering, \"How does he do it?\" Well, I\\'m going tell you. The secret ingredient is... Homer, no! Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children\\'s cough syrup! Shoot. Thank you, Mr. Nutball. Gotta go, Moe. Tough luck. Holy cow. You just fell on Aerosmith! Hey, Homer, come in here. Hi, Moe. Where\\'s that waitress of yours? Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here. Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret. I guess so. Compliments of the house. One \"Flaming Homer\". Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You\\'re the greatest friend a guy could ever have. Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight? I doubt it. It\\'s a breakthrough product, sir: scientifically formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits. Hot dog! And it\\'s mild enough to use every day. Isn\\'t life grand? What\\'s wrong sir, did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said \"No More Tears\". A lovely promise, but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo. Sir, I feel there is something you\\'re not telling me? Perhaps, you\\'d feel more comfortable talking to Snappy the Alligator. Maybe. Hello, Mr. Burns. Snappy, do you it\\'s hard to imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam homeruns and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen. Well there\\'s still time for all those things, sir. Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy. So you feel resentful towards the plant. Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it\\'s time I sold the old girl. Oh, what do they want! Maybe a nap will boost my spirits. I\\'ll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir. It\\'s not fair! I know how you feel, Simpson. I\\'ve never seen Mr. Burns so depressed. Uh-huh. People think that because he\\'s rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn\\'t have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn\\'t sell the plant for a hundred million dollars. Ooh, that\\'s a lot of money. Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar? Good, good. Try to eat something. Homer Simpson here. Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there\\'s no refund. Homer, it\\'s your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years. I own stock? Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights. So uh, how much did it go up? Wait a minute. Let\\'s not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive? Yeah... Like any sports? Sure... Ever go dancing? Not any more... We should get together sometime. That\\'d be great. There. Now we trust each other. Well... how are you? Near death. I\\'m renewing my notary license on a weekly basis. Uh-huh. So what\\'s my stock up to? Let me punch that up on the computer. Twenty five cents a share. What should I do? Well, let me put it this way. You\\'ll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now. Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars! Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer... Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial channel! Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing! Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed Burns Worldwide from one eighth to fifty-two and a quarter... Your father\\'s stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars! Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers. Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff? No, I\\'d like a bottle of Henry K. Duff\\'s Private Reserve. For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that\\'s my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy. Have a Duff, boys! Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer. Yeah, but thank you anyway. Hey, you guys aren\\'t from around here, are you? Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West. I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company. We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it? Well, I happen to know that he won\\'t sell it for less than 100 million dollars. A hundred million? Oh, don\\'t worry! We\\'ll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns. It\\'s the miracle we\\'ve been waiting for. What are we going to spend it on? Homer\\'s probably buying some magic beans with it right now. We\\'ll have a savings account. We\\'ve never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on. Hey... hey! Oh, Homer! You heard? We heard! Isn\\'t it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money. Well, I\\'m afraid I had some great plans, too. What do you mean? I spent it on beer. Surprise surprise. You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer? Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about? What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks. Ow! Come on everybody. It makes you feel better. Hey, Homer. Did you buy this car with your stock money? Sure did. And the great thing about it is everybody got rich. For once, all us working stiffs got a break. Hey, wait till you see Lenny. He just got back from the plastic surgeon. Jeez Lenny, looks like you got the works. Well it started out as an eye tuck, but the stock kept going up. Hey, come here, Mr. Burns is on TV. Mr. Burns, we\\'ve heard that a German consortium has offered to purchase the plant. Any comment? You\\'ll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant! Well then, sir, why are you meeting with them? So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein. Ah, you never cease to amaze me, sir. Whoo! oooh, oooh, Whooo hoo hoo! I grudgingly accept. Now, don\\'t worry. I think you\\'ll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that\\'s just John and Frank! Ich bin ein Springfielder! We could all lose our jobs. Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great. This is the worst day of my life. Those lousy Germans can\\'t fire me. I\\'m the only one who knows how to unjam the rod bottom dissociator. Well, they can\\'t fire me. I\\'m the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier. Well, they can\\'t fire me. Why? Cuz... I... Well, it\\'s a country in Europe -- Guten morgen, I am Horst. The new owners have elected me to speak with you because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan\\'s Heroes. Yeah, he does. What is the best way to an efficient plant? Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. So let\\'s get to know each other better. Do we have any alcoholics among us? You\\'ll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you\\'ll return at full pay. Lucky drunks. Also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety. We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector. Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst! Hey, Homer, aren\\'t you the safety inspector? That\\'s one big check. You look sharp today, sir. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. That was a gutsy decision, sir. Ein wassen das gutsy decisionen, mein herr. Ein wassen das... Smithers! Come here, I want you. I wanted to give you something to remember me by. I know you\\'ve always had your eye on this photo of Elvis and me. He was so good to his mother, sir. Yes, but I couldn\\'t understand a word that man said. Misht Burnsh, dajna boo mafrn friszner... er hound-dog. Stop it, you\\'re killing me sir. Oh sir, what will you do next? Well, first I\\'ll get that new hip I\\'ve been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell! Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany? Good, good, I\\'m learning. One of the economic powers of the world-- Because we send them money? No. Because they\\'re efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic. Oh, woa is me. Homie, come to bed. Oh, Marge, I\\'m gonna be fired. I know it. Don\\'t worry. Whatever happens, we\\'ll pay the bills somehow. Marge, it\\'s not the money. My job is my identity. If I\\'m not a safety whatchamajigger, I\\'m nothing. Well, if you can\\'t sleep, why don\\'t you do something constructive? Ooh, Battlestar Galactica. Fit, damn you! Fit! There. Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work. Huh? What? Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up! Homer, could we have a word with you? No. I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat? No! Once again, I have failed. Auugghh! You\\'ve been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time? Uh... all of them? I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well. I sure do! Such as... Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn\\'t so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy. This is my park! Get out! We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate. Mmm. The land of chocolate... Wow. Chocolate -- half price! La la la la la... Mr. Simpson... La la la la la la... Mr. Simpson... Oh, oh, oh. I\\'m sorry. We were talking about chocolate? That was ten minutes ago! I think I did pretty good in there. Yeah, you know those Germans aren\\'t so bad. Sure, they\\'ve made mistakes in the past, but that\\'s why pencils have erasers. Attention workers. We have completed our evaluation of the plant. We regret to announce the following lay-offs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all. Aye carumba! Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together \\'til your father gets a new job. I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together. That\\'s very clever. And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read \\'em and left \\'em in the store. Hmmm, you shouldn\\'t do that. My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together. That\\'s good, Lisa. I didn\\'t take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow. I want you to take baths, Bart. Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I\\'m not safe? Oh what\\'s the matter with this thing. No problems here. That\\'s right, Burnsie... keep your wrist supple... throw it, don\\'t aim it... It was worth it. This place has really gone to hell, Mr. Burns. It\\'s obscene what they did to your office. Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink? Would I! Fine. I gotta go. See you at six. You\\'re going down, my friend. Yes sir, Mr. Burns. That shouldn\\'t be. Raccoons! That\\'s right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children. Fools! Ready for that drink, sir? Just a second, Smithers. Let me introduce you to the gang. That\\'s Buzz. That\\'s Honey. And you see that queen over there? Her name is \"Smithers.\" Ha, ha. That\\'s very flattering, sir. But we should go. Several bees are stinging me. Moe\\'s Tavern. Moe speaking. Uh yes, I\\'m looking for a Mrs. O\\'Problem. First name... Bee. Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I\\'ll check. Uh, Bee O\\'Problem. Bee O\\'Problem. C\\'mon, guys. Do I have an O\\'Problem here? You sure do! Awwww. It\\'s you, isn\\'t it? Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I\\'m gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains! Bart, I want you to go down to Moe\\'s Tavern. I need you to bring your father home. Excuse me, I\\'m looking for -- Wait a minute. I know that voice. If it isn\\'t little Bart Simpson! I haven\\'t seen you in years. That\\'s right. That\\'s my pop! Ah, little Bart... we hear all about your monkeyshines. Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don\\'t even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right? Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls. That\\'s great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me? Moe, for you... anything? Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh, Smithers, let\\'s go slumming! EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO\\'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE\\'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY\\'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY\\'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC! He\\'s a pip, this one is! Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we\\'re going in! Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my \"buddy\" here. I\\'m not your buddy, you greedy old reptile! Smithers, who is this saucy fellow? Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated. That\\'s right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars. Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you\\'re feeling blue? Yes. Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night? Why, no. And does it ever say, \"I love you?\" No, it doesn\\'t. Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You\\'re old and you\\'re ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea! Nobody loves you... Good heavens, Smithers! They\\'re not afraid of me anymore! Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent? Letter? I don\\'t recall any letter... That\\'s because I forgot to stamp it. Ah, that kid slays me. That was no accident. Let\\'s get out of here. Na na na na / Na na na na / Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye... What good is money if you can\\'t inspire terror in your fellow man? I\\'ve got to get my plant back! Gott in himmel! Who\\'d have thought a nuclear plant could be such a deathtrap. It will cost us another hundred million just to bring it up to code. Please sell me my plant back! I\\'ll pay anything. Isn\\'t this a happy coincidence? You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell. Desperate, eh? Advantage, Burns. This is my offer. I think you\\'ll find it\\'s most unfair, but those are the breaks. But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you. That\\'s my final offer, take it or leave it. All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren\\'t all smiles and sunshine. Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I\\'m so scared. Ooh, the Germans. Uh-oh, the Germans are comin\\' to get me. Oh, don\\'t let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they\\'re so big and strong... Get out! This is my office now! Get out! You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house! Your orders, sir? Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar. Homer Simpson, but why? Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He\\'ll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head. And then one day... when he least expects it -- Woo-hoo! I got my job back! \"Barnacle Bill\\'s Home Pregnancy Test\"? Homer, shouldn\\'t we have gone with a better-known brand? But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe. Okay, let\\'s see... \"Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be\". Well, what color is it? Blue or purple? Pink. \"If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail\". Well, I guess I\\'d better go see Dr. Hibbert. Oh honey, do you really think you\\'re pregnant? Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids. Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get. Well, I\\'ll let you know. Hey, Homer, how come Mom\\'s going to the doctor? Is anything wrong? No, everything\\'s fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg. What? I smell a bun in the oven. Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad? Maybe. You\\'re a machine, Homer. Did you hear that Maggie? Another baby in the house. Ohhh, cool, we can race them. Yeah, sure, for you a baby\\'s all fun and games. For me, it\\'s diaper changes and midnight feedings. Doesn\\'t Mom do that stuff? Yeah, but I have to hear about it. Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me? Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the \\'80s. Hmmm, what do you think about? Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young! For several years I\\'d been dating your mother and working at the local fun center. Homer, you\\'re turning the blades too fast. The golfers are complaining. Slow down! That\\'s better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up and someday you\\'ll be the guy who hands out the putters. Yes, sir. I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future... Hey, you\\'re supposed to be listening to my story! I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year. It\\'s not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV. Don\\'t you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can\\'t keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh... Where do you think you\\'re going? You\\'re gonna listen to my story. Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters. Okay girls, you can smoke now. Umm... Oh yeah... It\\'s Homer! I don\\'t know what you see in that ugly meatball. Uh-huh. If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy, we could get a cat. It would leave less hair on the couch. You don\\'t know Homer like I do. He\\'s sensitive and sweet. Homer, do you ever think about the future? You mean like will apes be our masters? No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can\\'t imagine that job of yours is very stimulating. But it gives me time to think. Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you! I think about you, too. Wow, what an ending? Who\\'d have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker\\'s father. Marge, you\\'re as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda. Oh, Homer. YOU LIGHT UP MY DAYS / AND FILL MY NIGHTS / WITH SONG.... IT CAN\\'T BE WRONG / WHEN IT FEELS SO GOO/RIGHT / CAUSE YOU -- YOU Our song. I\\'ll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy. Actually, she was singing about God. Oh. Well he\\'s always happy. No, wait. He\\'s always mad. Someday I\\'ll buy you a real castle. You don\\'t have to do that. Phew, good. Homer, maybe it\\'s the Champale talking, but I think you\\'re pretty sexy. Really? It must be the Champale talking. What if we get caught? Don\\'t worry. This castle is impregnable! Pass the cookie dough. Dust off your hula skirts, Angels, I\\'m afraid there\\'s been a murder - in Hawaii! Hawaii it is, Charlie. Y\\'ello... Oh, hi Marge... I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer. Why? What\\'s wrong? Well, that unforgettable night we... joined the Castle Club... Oh. Well, Miss Bouvier. I... I think we found the reason why you\\'ve been throwing up in the morning. Congratulations. ... ... Perhaps this pamphlet will prove helpful. So You\\'ve Ruined Your Life. Son, you gotta marry that girl! Because it\\'s the honorable thing to do? No, because you\\'ll never do any better. You lucky bum! The fish jumped right in the boat. All you gotta do is whack her with the oar. Marge, there\\'s something I want to ask you. But I\\'m afraid, because if you say no it\\'ll destroy me and make me a criminal. Well, I haven\\'t said no to you lately, have I? Marge, I... Damn it, where\\'s that card? What card? Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket. Is this it? What\\'s it say? \"Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don\\'t have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?\" That\\'s the card. Give it here. Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life! So... will you marry me? Yes. Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She\\'s gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo! Dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel? I\\'m sorry, the baby\\'s name will be Kool Moe Dee Simpson. Ariel. Kool Moe Dee. Ariel. Kool Moe Dee. Ariel. Kool Moe Dee. You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago. Homer, I\\'ve been thinking. If the baby\\'s a boy, what do you think of the name Larry? Marge, we can\\'t do that! All the kids\\'ll call him Larry Fairy. Well, how about Louie? They\\'ll call him Screwy Louie. Bob? Slob. Luke? Puke. Marcus? Mucous. What about Bart? Let\\'s see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can\\'t see any problem with that. Wow! I\\'ll take that ring! Yes sir, and how will you be paying for it? I don\\'t know. Finally, the big day came. We didn\\'t have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line. Basic ceremony\\'s twenty bucks. Here\\'s your license. Be sure to get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house. Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever. No matter how many times I hear that, it always makes me laugh. Cletus, do you take Aline to be your lawful wedded wife? Yup. Done. Next. There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling. Marge, I\\'m sorry. I wish I could afford a better place. Homer, I\\'d be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband. I am? Well, you may not look like Ted Bessell, but you\\'re just as nice. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join... Homer. ... and... Marge. ... in holy matrimony. Beautiful. Don\\'t be stupid. Do you, Marjorie Bouvier, take Homer J. Simpson to be your lawful wedded husband? I do. Homer, same question, names reversed. I do. Then, by the power vested in me by the state gaming commission, I pronounce you man and wife. Here\\'s ten dollars worth of chips, you may kiss the bride. Next! What a perfect day. Our first night together as man and wife. Hey! Lovebirds! Keep it down! Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor. Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over. Homer, I don\\'t know how we can afford all these things on your salary. Hey, why don\\'t I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well. I don\\'t know. I heard radiation can make you sterile. Pfft. Now you tell me. We only have two openings, so I\\'m afraid one of you will have to go home empty-handed... But it won\\'t be my old frat buddy, Lou Collier. How ya doin\\', you old Alpha Tau! Smithers, you keg-meister, you. Well, hey, I\\'m from Alabama Chapter! I\\'ll be. Well, let\\'s get on with the testing. Roll on, roll on, Alpha Tau -- Bow wow wow wow Bow wow wow wow... Hmmm, if I didn\\'t know better, I\\'d swear he was trying to moon us. What would each of you say is your worst quality? Well, I am a workaholic. I push myself too hard. Dear Marge, XXX. Homer. Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I\\'m kind of a goof-off... Okay, that\\'ll do. ... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace. That\\'s enough! Next: there\\'s a problem with the reactor, what do you do? There\\'s a problem with the reactor?! We\\'re all gonna die!!! Did you get the job? Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life. Oh, Homie. Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking. Wow! Kid, I won\\'t let you down. I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you\\'re gonna see is a man with a good job. Yeah, the doctor. ... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold. What a crappy candle! You\\'ve ruined our vacation! ... You, gentle sir, are fired! Oh! Oh, hello, young man. Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co. Handle first, handle first... I quit! I quit! I thought you said you liked dogs. Hey, who wants to get rich today? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first! First, let me assure you that this is not one of those shady \"pyramid schemes\" you\\'ve been hearing about. All right! Stick it to the Man. No sir. Our model is the trapezoid that guarantees each investor an 800% return within hours of your initial... Uh-oh! The cops! \"Fourth Notice\"... \"90 Days Overdue\"... \"We Break Thumbs\"... Homer, what are we going to do? I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know -- Repo Man! I\\'m here for the baby\\'s things. Crib, mobile, monitor... oh, and the lady\\'s ring, I\\'m afraid. Oh dear... Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job. \"Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn\\'t want me here.\" Shut up with that pen-scratching down there! I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man. That is so sad. Oh, c\\'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn\\'t be here today if I hadn\\'t become the responsible head of a household. Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch? Okay. \"You will not see me again until I am a man.\" Oh, Homer, Homer. There, there, dear. We\\'re all in shock. I thought he\\'d two-time you for a while first. This taco is full of hair. Uh huh. There\\'s your explanation. Ahh! Should we tell Marge where he is? Nah. Let her read about it in the Society page. Homer ?! Marge, listen... We just saw... Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes... They get donuts? That\\'s right. All the colors of the rainbow. Wowww. Marge, what are you doing up? You need your rest, dear. I heard a noise outside and thought it might be Homer. What the hell. Marge I\\'ve got two-and-a-half words for you. Gulp \\'N\\' Blow. Yeah, what do you want? My husband by my side. You want fries with that? Homer? Marge? Homer! Marge! Holy cow, you\\'re as big as a house. Homer... Come home with me. No, Marge, I just can\\'t. I mean, look at me. I\\'m a Trainee... They won\\'t even tell me what\\'s in the secret sauce. But I can\\'t buy you a decent wedding ring. Any ring is fine as long as it\\'s from you. Marge, for you. Aww... Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger. Oh, sure. Homer, do you know why I married you? Because I knocked you up? No, because I love you. Come home soon. That\\'s it. That\\'s it. Come closer... Ironic, isn\\'t it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive. You the boss? Yes. I\\'ll call security, sir. Step aside! I\\'ll deliver this baby! Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you\\'re looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I\\'m your man. You can treat me like dirt and I\\'ll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don\\'t like it... I can change!! Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless. Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet on his way out. I don\\'t care. I haven\\'t been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers. You mean? Welcome aboard, son. I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job! Who was that young hellcat, Smithers? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? I\\'ll remember that name. Marge!... Marge!... You\\'re a little late. She\\'s gone to the hospital. The hospital? I\\'ll drive you. Thanks, mom. Don\\'t ever call me that. Marge! Marge, where\\'s the baby? Right where you left it. Shut up! Hey, listen fatboy -- No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I\\'m paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect! Homer, does this mean -- Starting tomorrow, I\\'m a nuclear technician! Good God. And tomorrow morning, I\\'m gonna buy your ring back! Then I\\'m going house-hunting! Doesn\\'t your job start tomorrow? Eh, somebody\\'ll cover for me. Homer, that\\'s -- Ohh! Uh, why don\\'t you let me handle it, Homer? Oh, college boy, eh? Homer, for God\\'s sakes, let him deliver the baby! Homie, isn\\'t he beautiful? Hey, as long as he\\'s got eight fingers and eight toes, he\\'s fine by me. Ahh, Bart. Daddy\\'s little angel. Why you little... He did that on purpose! How could he? He\\'s only ten minutes old. Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute... Y\\'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have. As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more. And not a day goes by that we don\\'t thank God for all three of you. Homer, I\\'m not pregnant. Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge! Yes! Aw, ain\\'t that cute... Hey! Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present? Mon-ey. Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars. Oh, sorry. That\\'s very righteous. Funky C Funky Do will be back to lip sync another one of their hits, right after this. Hey kids! Why sit in front of the TV, when you can be on the radio!? WE\\'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN\\' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY... That could be Bart! Throw away your bulky transmitters and broadcasting towers... The SuperStar celebrity microphone lets you hear your voice through any AM radio! Hey good lookin\\', we\\'ll be back to pick you up later. He\\'s in for some lovin\\'. It\\'s the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations, board meetings. You\\'re fired! Hm... Bart\\'s birthday\\'s coming up. But order now, supply is limited. Limited?! Do you have any of those microphones left? Yeah, a couple. Y\\'know, Marge. Bart\\'s really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won\\'t be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I\\'ll buy his love yet. Okay, Sideshow Mel, bring out the birthday cake! Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel mops up, let\\'s see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today! All right! Here comes my name! Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent. Bart, your Grampa\\'s on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday. Isn\\'t that nice? Take a message. Right now I\\'m off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services. I\\'m here for my free birthday sundae. Eat it and get out. Digital audio tape, my butt! When I was a kid, we had compact discs, and I don\\'t recall no one complaining. Damn right. Sorry, Rosarita. I gotta get to my birthday party. Farewell, SeÃ±or Bart! Hey, good to see ya. Glad you could make it. Toby, have you lost weight? Uh-oh, here comes trouble. It\\'s Wally! Hey Wally, do something funny! Hey, later, okay... hey, why don\\'t you go bug your parents? Cool, Larry the Looter! Hey there, I hear it\\'s your birthday. How old are you? Well, I\\'m -- That\\'s great! Would you like us to sing you a special song? Hell, no. You got it! Ready, SeÃ±or Beaver-otti? I\\'m-a ready. And-a one and-a two... YOU\\'RE THE BIRTHDAY / YOU\\'RE THE BIRTHDAY / YOU\\'RE THE BIRTHDAY BOY OR GIRL. Wha th...? It\\'s a label maker. Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Patty\\'s stubble in my leg razor. Ehhh... Bart, I\\'ll bet you think nothin\\'s gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present! Next. Bart! Be polite. Next, please. Bart, I\\'ve noticed your birthday presents are a poor crop at best. I hope this turns the tide. Just gorgeous. Now we can be twins! There\\'s only one can of beer left and it\\'s Bart\\'s. Hey boy, how\\'s the microphone working? Fine. Bart! I would love to get a present like that. Here you go. Enjoy. Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch. WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN\\' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN\\'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY Quit it, Dad! Hey good-lookin\\', we\\'ll be back for some dinner later! Wha\\'d you say? I can\\'t understand you with all that distortion. What a crappy birthday. What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids. Y\\'know Bart, I don\\'t think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn\\'t talk into it as loud as your father does. Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that? Hey, it does work! I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don\\'t you go show your father? Hmmm. Mmmmm. Chocolate. Mmmmm. Chocolate. Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream. I\\'ll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer. Mmmmm. Chocolate. People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless. We have captured your president. He was delicious. Why, you little... Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present? Uh-huh. Aww... Just promise me you won\\'t play anymore practical jokes. I promise. Mama! Mama! Maggie! You talked! Can you say \"mama\" again? Sorry lady, show\\'s over. Oh, Bart. I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off. Oh, brotherrr. Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for! Bravo! Well done, old man. Rod... Todd... this is God. How did you get on the radio? Forgive my brother. We believe you. Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later. What do you want from us? I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch. But those cookies belong to our parents. Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God? Happy God. Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies. Yes, sir. Whoops! Help! Help! Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin\\' at the old well. Help me, please! I fell down the well! I\\'ll get help, laddie! A little nip of courage. Out of my way! Look out, you horse\\'s arse! Sucker. Hey, what\\'s up? Some fool kid fell down a well. Yes! My name is Timmy O\\'Toole. I just turned ten years old. Timmy, where are your parents? Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes. He\\'s a liar! Booooooo! The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city\\'s police force is slender enough to rescue the boy. By God, men -- you\\'re a bunch of marshmallows! Why don\\'t you go, Chief? I\\'m too... important. Is it Sherri? Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig. In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions. Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch! I don\\'t think he\\'s coming back. With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I\\'ll land your boy. And I\\'ll clean him for free. Although we can\\'t reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him. Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O\\'Toole, trapped in that well. Bart! What\\'s wrong with you? Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero. How do you mean, dad? Well, he fell down a well... and can\\'t get out... How does that make him a hero? Well, it\\'s more than you did! And finally, Channel Six\\'s own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called \"We\\'re Sending Our Love Down The Well.\" I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, \"Krusty, when do you need me?\" I said Thursday -- he said, \"I\\'m busy Thursday\" -- I said, \"What about Friday?\" He said, \"Friday\\'s worse than Thursday.\" Then he said, \"How about Saturday?\" I said, \"Fine.\" True story. Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, \\'69. In fact, he fired me as I recall. Sting. But this isn\\'t about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we\\'ve all got to do what we can. THERE\\'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO\\'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL. THOUGH WE CAN\\'T GET HIM OUT / WE\\'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING. Gas! Out of the hole! AND WE\\'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL! ALL THE WAY DOWN. WE\\'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL! DOWN THAT WELL! Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties? Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren\\'t free... Whatever\\'s left, we throw down the well. Authentic Timmy O\\'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag! Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back. Awww. Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy! This is a special report from Channel Six news. Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O\\'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse. I... a, it\\'s very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here\\'s an artist\\'s conception. Bart! I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn\\'t get through my sock. Goodnight everybody. Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you\\'ve been fooling them, they\\'re gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors. Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out? The police will catch you sooner or later. The police. They couldn\\'t catch a cold. Maybe not, but I bet you\\'re stupid enough to have left a \"Property of Bart Simpson\" label on that radio. And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. I think he\\'s asleep. Want to get a cup of coffee? Okay. Brave little guy. Hey, I almost tripped over this thing. What did I do to deserve this? Help! Help! I fell down the well. Tell us something we don\\'t know. No! My name is Bart Simpson! What are you doing down there? Look, I\\'ll level with you. There is no Timmy O\\'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody. Well, you sure fooled us, kid. Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let\\'s go home and go to sleep. . Good one, Eddie. Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys? So I\\'m afraid your son is trapped down the well. You must think we\\'re the worst parents in the world. Yeah, that\\'s... pretty much the feeling down at the station. Don\\'t worry, son. Just \\'cause you\\'re trapped in a hole doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll... Ow! Knock it off you bald boob! Hey, don\\'t make me come down there! Like to see you fit. Why, you little -- Put a man on him. I liked the other boy. So polite. What are you doing to save my baby boy? Uh well, ma\\'am, we\\'ve located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split. Well, why don\\'t you get it? Well, I\\'m afraid we\\'ve got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo. You\\'re telling me that the city won\\'t pay to get a boy out of a well? Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps. Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes. Back in the hole! No! So it seems we\\'ve all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy\\'s parents. It\\'s not our fault. We didn\\'t want the boy, he was an accident. Homer! Uh, could you edit that last part out? Mr. Simpson, we\\'re live coast-to-coast. One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson\\'s buried alive / He\\'s so neat / He\\'s so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat. Hey, stop that! Sorry, Lisa. How many days until Bart croaks. One, two, three, four... And our new number one hit, \"I Do Believe We\\'re Naked\", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces \"We\\'re Sending Our Love Down The Well\", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven. Ever since I\\'ve called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I \\'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, \"Let him stay down there!\" Yeah, Shutton here. Now that\\'s a story! Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you\\'re down in the well. Mom, it\\'s too big. Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll grow into it. Homer! You know, I\\'ve done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I\\'m paying the price. But there\\'s so many things I\\'ll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair... That\\'s all I can stands, I can\\'t stands no more. I\\'m gonna get you outta there myself. Now, why didn\\'t I think of that? Agnes, we\\'ve got work to do. This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin. The Lincoln Squirrel has been assassinated. We\\'ll stay with the story all night if we have to. What\\'s going on? It\\'s an old fashioned hole diggin\\'. By gar, it\\'s been a while. The canary! Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest. Not while one of my fans needs me. Actually, I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever heard Bart play one of your albums-- Shh! Marge, he\\'s a good digger. Sting! Mom! Dad! Oh Bart, I\\'ve missed you so much. Man, I was so scared. Don\\'t worry son, they\\'re gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again. That should do it. Hey everybody, Bret Gunsilman here in pivotal week three of the NFL on Fox. Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action. Well, bye-bye belt. Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can\\'t be good for your heart. Pfft, my heart is just fine. A little beer will put out that fire. And now with his picks for today\\'s games, the man who\\'s right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo. Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call. But if you\\'re one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don\\'t know... uh... Denver. Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah! Moe\\'s Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly. Moe, I\\'d like to bet twenty dollars on Denver. I think I can provide that service. Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book? Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster. Twenty big ones on Denver. Pleasure doing business with you, H. S. All right, Denver. Justify my love. I don\\'t know, the Dolphins. At the end of thirteen seconds of play, it\\'s New England seven, Denver nothing. Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter... DAAAAAD! You\\'re not listening to me. Lousy, stupid Denver. Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you\\'re so clever. Why isn\\'t Dad ever interested in anything I do? Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does? No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it. Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I\\'m interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I\\'ll tell you about when you\\'re older. Do you understand? I think so. Bart! Whaaat? Ho, look at that score. Moxy! Why did you do that? Wouldn\\'t it be fun if we watched the game together? Okay, just don\\'t say anything and sit down over there. Over. Over... over... over... Lisa, please, I can\\'t hear the announcer. He said Denver just fumbled. See you in Hell, soldier boy! Bart? Yeah mom? I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping. Mom, I\\'d love to. But to be honest, I don\\'t need new clothes. Oh really? Hmm... So even though I\\'d love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It\\'s not... Well folks, when you\\'re right fifty-two percent of the time, you\\'re wrong forty-eight percent of the time. Why didn\\'t you say that before! Okay, Jimmy, you\\'re off the hook. We\\'ve got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts? I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy\\'s \"Lock of the Week.\" Oooh, that\\'s a big lock all right. I just don\\'t trust that guy. In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my \"Shoe-in of the Week\". Huh, they both make a good case. After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk! You want some of this don\\'t ya? Yeah! Well you need to know the winners. And I know the winners. So call me now! Whoa! Five dollars for the first minute. Two dollars for each additional minute. You have reached the Coach\\'s hot... Line... line. Yeah, lay it on me, coach. In the game of Mi-a-mi... Mm-hm. ...versus Cin- Cincinnati... cin- Cincinnati. nat- Cincinnati. ti... C\\'mon, c\\'mon! Don\\'t you realize this is costing me money? We must consider many things. The wind... Doh, not the wind. ...is blowing out of the west... Oh... at five ... miles per hour. knots... Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think\\'s gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins? Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins. Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello? Moe, it\\'s me Mr. \"K.\" Yeah, yeah, what\\'ll it be? Put me down for seven hundred dollars on the Rams. Oh, and put Sideshow Mel down for two grand. Mom, I\\'m tired. I wanna go home. Can\\'t I just lie down for a minute? Now Bart, I think you\\'d look very sharp in this shirt. Fine, get it. Lets go. No, no, no, you have to try it on. Oooh, and this one\\'s fifty percent off. You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up. Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn\\'t your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... And these... Oh look! Little bow ties. And don\\'t make that face at me. How\\'d ya know? Touchdown Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Fifty big ones! Fifty big ones? Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy\\'s friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game. You mean you made a bet? Well, I wouldn\\'t call it a bet. It\\'s a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting. What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football? Well... you know... you like ice cream, don\\'t you? Uh-huh. See how good things can happen if you make a little effort? And don\\'t you like ice cream better when it\\'s covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things... So gambling makes a good thing even better. That\\'s right. My God, it\\'s like there\\'s some kind of bond between us. We\\'ve got a trouble maker in booth eight. Forget him. There\\'s a code red in booth three. My God. Those aren\\'t the socks she came in with. Un-unn. Let\\'s move. Bart? In here, Mom. But don\\'t open the-- Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too. ...three, two, one... And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10. YEAH! Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars. You\\'d think that wouldn\\'t you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it\\'s okay in the Bible. Really, where? Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let\\'s not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay? Okay, dad. Did you two have fun? You bet. Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends. You gotta come out sometime, Simpson. Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today. Me too, honey. Can I watch football with you again next Sunday? Sure! You\\'ll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church. Point well taken. Uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight and it\\'s cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs. This team is fired up! We came here to play! All right! He\\'ll lose. What? Didn\\'t you hear what he said? Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He\\'s a little boy, lost in a game of men. You think we should bet against them? I\\'d bet my entire college fund on it. You got it. Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York. Start spreadin\\' the news, it\\'s New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten. Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I\\'m getting nauseous. Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games? Well, I like the 49ers because they\\'re pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat. And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win. Hey, the new sign is really working. It\\'s been a madhouse, Lisa. Let\\'s see... football... Football: homo-eroticism in... oddball Canadian rules... Phyllis George and... Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin\\' high. Who would have thunk it? My daughter, that\\'s who! Yeah, me! Lisa, you\\'ve picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift. C\\'mon, dad. It doesn\\'t take a genius to realize that Houston\\'s failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game. Oh, my little girl says the cutest things. You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week. Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day. The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills. Okay, ya lucky moron. Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars. I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it\\'s the smell of victory. Aw, shut up. Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal. Tut-tut. Only the best for my family. Homer, I can\\'t help wondering where you\\'re getting the money from? Mom, can\\'t a man do something nice for his loved ones? Hmm, I guess so. Hello, I\\'m Marco. I\\'ll be your waiter. Hello, I\\'m Homer. I\\'ll be your customer. Never heard that one before. Uh, would you care to select the wine? I\\'ll do the honors. No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop. Charming lad. Oh, violin guy! What\\'s your favorite song, Lisa? The Broken Neck Blues. Play on. It is the play-offs, it\\'s five below and there\\'s one loyal fan wearing nothing but a g-string and the team colors painted on his body. He doesn\\'t look too happy. Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he\\'s slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan. Well, Lisa, it\\'s Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter\\'s picks. You promised you wouldn\\'t get mad! Dad, I\\'m making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I\\'d like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago. Good, good... You call Moe. Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S. Just give me the bet, Lisa. Hundred and ten, a hundred and twenty... You lucky son-of-a... Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday? Barney, are you nuts? That\\'s the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that? Well, my ma\\'s coming in from Norway, but... uh what the hell. And when the doctor said I didn\\'t have worms anymore -- that was the happiest day of my life. Thank you, Ralph. Very graphic. Lisa Simpson? Would you like to read your essay? The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy\\'s knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread. Dear God! Oh dad, you must\\'ve bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is. Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers. Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep\\'s \"Versatility.\" Boy, I know you\\'re gonna like your present. Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell. Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this. Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from. All right, Marge. I\\'ll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad. I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won\\'t. All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football. Homer! I did not! I promised I would get mad! She\\'s an eight-year-old girl. But Marge, she never loses. She\\'s got a gift. Aren\\'t parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent? But gambling is illegal. Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it\\'s a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it\\'s brought Lisa and me together. Well, I just don\\'t know. Look, what\\'s the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I\\'ve got that foot massager I\\'ve always wanted. Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this. You know, dad, we\\'ve been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets. Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I\\'m going bowling with Barney. What about Daddy-Daughter day? Don\\'t worry, the new football season is only seven months away. So that\\'s it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all. You\\'re a very selfish man. Go to hell! Go to hell! Hey, once again. Great present, Dad. My third husband bought me this. Give me some chips for it. Are you sure, ma\\'am? Don\\'t tell me what to do, Sonny. I\\'ve been gambling since I was eight. And I\\'ve been hockin\\' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips! Look around you, Malibu Stacey. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic. You\\'re going back into the shoe-box. It may not be pretty, but dammit, it\\'s honest. I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories! Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat. Huh? So you\\'ve come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer. Look Lisa, honey, I\\'m sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me. Yeah, I did. Well, c\\'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can\\'t we? Eh? Huh? Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about. It\\'s a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread? Put me down. Look dad, I\\'ll tell you who\\'s gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it\\'ll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me. Okay. I think Dallas is a mortal lock. Dallas! Whoo-hoo! However... However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what? However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I\\'d bet the farm on Buffalo. Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: \"Daddy should bet all his money on...\" I don\\'t know. If I still love you, Dallas. If I don\\'t, Buffalo. Homer, I think that chip\\'s got enough dip on it. We\\'re live from Miami Florida home of Super Bowl Twenty-nine. Today we\\'re gonna be seen by people in over one hundred fifty countries all over the world. Including our latest stolen affiliates overseas. Stupide. Whaa! I\\'m sorry Mrs. Wellenmelon. Formidable! Oh, this sucks. C\\'mon snipers. Where are you? Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here. Moe\\'s Tavern, Home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular. Oh! Baloney. Bread! Gotcha ya down for forty bucks. Good luck Your Eminence. Sorry, Homer, you can\\'t take any more of my money. I\\'m, uh, outta the bookie business. But Moe, you\\'ve been taking bets all... Hey Barney, how \\'bout a free beer? Wow! Don\\'t worry, Moe. I\\'m not bettin\\'. What? Gimme that. I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it. Well sir, we\\'re two hours and forty-five minutes into the pre-game show and we\\'ve got ourselves a special guest. Actor Troy McClure, whose new sitcom is premiering tonight -- coincidentally enough, right after the game! Thanks, Bret. My new show\\'s called \"Handle with Care\". I play Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We\\'re the original odd couple! What made you want to do a situation comedy? Well, I fell in love with the script, Bret, and my recent trouble with the IRS sealed the deal. Could be another Drexel\\'s Class. Ooh, looks like we\\'re almost ready for the kickoff. Dallas kicks -- oh, it\\'s a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo\\'s going to start with excellent field position. Buffalo\\'s gonna win. Lisa hates me! Whatcha got riding on this game? My daughter. What a gambler. That was the score at the half. Buffalo fourteen: Dallas seven. It\\'s time for the never tedious Super Bowl halftime show. People of Earth, we\\'ve come ten billion light years to bring you this halftime message of peace. Bart, who\\'s winning? You hate dad is up by a touchdown. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yea!! It\\'s a touchdown for half-back Dan Beer-dorf! Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl! They wanted it more. Hey Homer, didn\\'t you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you? Not Duff Dry... Dallas. Okay, okay. They\\'re both great teams. Huh? Touchdown Cowboys! All right, we\\'re back in business. Well, I\\'m glad some people could resist the lures of the big game. Oh my God, I forgot the game! So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans\\'ll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here\\'s the handoff. Please, please, please... Touchdown! Stick a fork in this one. It is done. The Dallas Cowboys wins Super Bowl twenty-nine. I guess you love dad. I suspected as much. Yes! She loves me! She loves me! What are you so happy about Homer? You didn\\'t win any money. Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years! Come on, Dad! It\\'s beautiful. Isn\\'t it though? After I catch my breath... can we... go... home? I am not cleaning that... Ah, who am I kidding? That\\'s it? Now Maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want. Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer.... Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese... One at a time! One at a time! Don\\'t even bother with the raisins. I\\'m not gonna eat \\'em... Double bologna! Double bologna!... I don\\'t ask for much, just no pimento. Don\\'t forget to make it double bologna \\'cause I can hardly... That\\'s enough! There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, your hat\\'s where you left it, behind the toilet. Homer, I\\'ll sew your pants but I\\'m out of bologna. Thanks mom. Thanks mom. Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer\\'s dry-cleaning -- I think that\\'s everything. Marge, can you take my ball to Nick\\'s today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole. Homer, I\\'m running late as it is. Can\\'t you just use one of the balls at the alley? Alley balls? Alright, don\\'t whine. Just put it in my left hand. Kids! Hurry up or you\\'re going to miss your bus! No way. Never happen. Well, I\\'ll be damned. Mom, Bart\\'s making faces at me. It\\'s a nervous twitch and I\\'m a little sensitive about it if you don\\'t mind. Mom, he\\'s doing it again. Bart, quit it! Quit it! Hey quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Mommmmm!! Get out. Fruit leather... Tree Fresh Imitation Orange Drink... Krusty brand duck sausage pizza... Sorry lady, you\\'ve got the wrong Nick\\'s. You want Nick\\'s on the other side of town. Eh, I don\\'t know what Nicky\\'s telling you. I haven\\'t flushed a ball in years. Oh, this miserable stress headache. Feels like there\\'s a rat in my brain. It\\'s time for another Bill and Marty Classic Crank Call. Hello, is this Mr. Justin Sherman? Yes? Sir, your wife is dead. Oh God! No! That\\'s right. She just walked through a plate glass window. There\\'s blood everywhere. And I just talked to her! AHHH!! Bart\\'s making faces. Where\\'s my lucky red cap? Alley balls... Your wife is dead. I haven\\'t flushed a ball in years. NOOOOOOOO!! Look, lady, this better be good. This is Arnie Pie with \"Arnie in the Sky\". We\\'ve got big problems on the Springfield Memorial Bridge, people. Traffic goin\\' wa-ay back in both directions. And look out at the corner of fourteenth and Elm \\'cause I just dropped my bagel. She\\'s locked in the car and refuses to move. Did you flash your lights? Yes. Well, I\\'m fresh out of ideas. All right! A chance to catch some rays. C\\'mon, c\\'mon, I got a body in the trunk! Mr. Teeny, stop fiddling with the buttons! Oh, now you\\'ve gotten chocolate all over everything. This is Kent Brockman, reporting live from Arnie Pie\\'s traffic copter. But I can assure you, this is no mere morning traffic report. Hey. Face the facts, Arnie. An overworked and under-appreciated housewife has snapped and parked her car on the bridge refusing to budge. This reporter is now going to be lowered down in the Channel Six Sky Harness for an exclusive interview. Hey sweetheart, what\\'s the matter?! Not gettin\\' enough of the good stuff at home? Let me through! Let me through! I\\'m her husband! Well, that explains a lot. Try to talk her out of there. But don\\'t put your lips on it or anything. Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello? Homer? Is that you? What should I say? How about, \"Yes, it\\'s me\". Yes it\\'s me! Tell her you love her. I love you very much. And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle. Haw haw! Why don\\'t you just wrap it up? Look Marge, I can tell something\\'s bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey? Okay. Cuff her boys. Off the record, ma\\'am, all the gals on the force knew just how you felt. That\\'s nice. Do you think you could loosen my cuffs? No. Don\\'t you worry, Mr. Mayor, this little bird will be crackin\\' rocks by the end of the week. Wiggum, you glorified night watchman, let her go! But she broke the law. Thanks for the civics lesson. Now listen to me. If Marge Simpson goes to jail, I can kiss the chick vote goodbye. And if I go down, you\\'re gonna break my fall! Word to the wise, Quimby. Don\\'t write checks your butt can\\'t cash. Hear me loud and clear, Wiggum. You bite me, I\\'ll bite back. You talk the talk, Quimby. But do you walk the walk? I hereby declare today to be \"Marge Simpson Day\" in the city of Springfield. They\\'re like trained seals. Toss \\'em a fish and watch \\'em slap their fins together. Well, all\\'s well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge. Many years ago, the Spanish explorers discovered a little piece of heaven nestled in the Springfield Mountains. They called it \"Rancho Relaxo,\" and so do we. Today it\\'s Springfield\\'s only two-star health spa. Swim, play tennis or just sit and stare at the walls. At Rancho Relaxo, you\\'re the boss. Remember, you can\\'t spell \"Relaxo\" without \"relax\". Homer Whaa... I need a vacation. What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns? I need to unwind. I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. \"Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\" And let\\'s face it, I\\'m no day at the beach either. \"Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?\" No. I mean a vacation by myself. What? You mean we\\'re getting a divorce? Marge, I can change! No Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations. Well, okay. But you have to swear you\\'re comin\\' back. I swear. All right then. Thanks again for taking the children while I\\'m away. Don\\'t worry yourself. Uh-huh. We\\'ve got six months of maternity leave we\\'re never gonna use anyway. Homer, can you bring Maggie out? Wish I\\'d thought of that. She\\'s startin\\' to give. Homer! If Maggie really doesn\\'t want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you. Are you sure that\\'s wise? Uh-huh. He\\'ll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine. For your information, I can take care of my -- See? Got her on the first bounce. All aboard for Shelbyville, Badwater, Cattle Skull Testing Grounds and Rancho Relaxo. Goodbye, Homie. Good bye? Where\\'s my clean underwear? Check the dryer! How often should I change Maggie? Whenever she needs it. Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker? Don\\'t. This is Coma -- WKOMA. Restful, easy listening. Coming up next, a super set of songs about clouds. Hello Maggie. Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away... So, it\\'s going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me. Kids, you haven\\'t touched your tongue sandwiches. You need something to drink? We\\'ve got Clamato, Mr. Pibb and soy milk. Cool! That\\'s alright. I think I\\'ll just hit the hay. It\\'s 12:30 in the afternoon. I\\'m aware of the time. Lisa, you\\'ll sleep in my bed. Bart, you\\'ll be sleeping with your Aunt Patty. In your bed? Uh huh. And I should warn you, I\\'m told I snore. Move, Divorce Court\\'s on in fifteen minutes. I\\'m scared, Lisa. You think you know fear? Well, I\\'ve seen them naked. Aaah! Oh, hello! And welcome to Rancho Relaxo! I\\'m Troy Mc Clure. You might remember me from such films as \"Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die,\" and \"Gladys, The Groovy Mule.\" But today you\\'ll see me in my greatest role -- your video tour guide to Rancho Relaxo! Our tour starts in your very own room, where Relaxo Vision offers you the latest Hollywood hits. And after midnight, the finest \"R\" rated movies Europe has to offer. Ooh-la-la! Today\\'s selections are... \"Thelma and Louise,\" \"The Happy Little Elves Meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck,\" and \"The Erotic Awakening of S\". Chef Rodrigo, what are you up to? Well, taste for yourself, Troy. Mmm-mmm-mmm! That can\\'t be good for me -- it tastes too good! That\\'s where you\\'re wrong, Troy. This whole pot is only fourteen calories. Ahh... Ahh... Gregory, where have you been all my life? Feeling tense? Uh-huh. Then just push nine on your phone. Then the pound sign. Then four-eight-three. We\\'ll do the rest. C\\'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num. Mmm. Strained peas. Let go! Marge, it\\'s times like this I\\'m glad I flunked out of that Mexican med school. Hi Homie. I feel much better. Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company. No problem. Well, well, if it isn\\'t little Bart. Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey Homer, let me hold him. All right, but just be careful. Whoa... someone smells stinky. Oh, it\\'s me. Bart you really shouldn\\'t be looking through other people\\'s things. Find anything good? I\\'ve said it before and I\\'ll say it again... Aye carumba! Hey, Lis -- Bang! Bang! Ah, Bart! That\\'s a black-head gun! Eew! Best MacGyver ever. Mm-hmm. Richard Dean Anderson will be in my dreams tonight. GO TO SLEEP AND GOODNIGHT/ DA DA DA / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ DEE DEE DEE / DEE DEE / May your Christmas day be nice. Goodnight, my little pork chop. Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding. Heh, heh, heh. Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? Maggieeee!!!! Oh man, you want a bad night, try sleeping on one of these. Barney, I\\'ve lost the baby. It\\'s the worst thing I\\'ve ever done. Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry. You know what I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna make you an omlette. Just help me look! Are you sure? I make \\'em with two kinds of cheese. C\\'mon! Hey, Homer. I think I\\'ve got her. Come on! Barney! You\\'re gonna pull her arm off. The sooner I get her out, the sooner we can have omlettes. So, what\\'s the verdict? Oh, dear God! I can\\'t even put a bag over my head! Yes, you can. Hello... I\\'d like the department of missing babies. Please hold. \"Bungee jumping, kayaking, calligraphy, cigar making, hula dancing... hmm... I guess I\\'ve done everything. By now you\\'ve seen what Rancho Relaxo has to offer. Uh-huh. But remember, we can\\'t tell you how to have a good time. You have to tell us. Oh. As I said to Dolores Montenegro in \"Calling All Quakers\": \"Have it your way, baby.\" Hello, room service? This is Marge Simpson. I\\'d like a hot fudge sundae. With whipped cream. And some chocolate chip cheesecake. And a bottle of tequila. Let\\'s get outta here, Thelma. Okay Louise. What do you want? I came to see the kids. Wait here. And don\\'t steal any light bulbs. Hmmm. Dad! Hey kids... uh... you haven\\'t seen Maggie around anyplace have you? Uh-um. Well, I gotta go. C\\'mon kids, it\\'s time to rub Aunt Patty\\'s feet. Hello Guv\\'nor. Lube job while you wait? Don\\'t touch me. Y\\'ello. Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away? Homer, that\\'s awful! Oh. Well, I\\'ve got good news for you. The dog didn\\'t run away. Well, good. I\\'m coming home, honey. You can pick me up at the train station in an hour. And bring the kids. Bye! Please, don\\'t jump. I know you\\'re going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead of you! Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It\\'s not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn\\'t life funny? One day they\\'re babies, the next thing you know, they\\'re off on their own. Oh. You the man who reported the lost baby? Yes. Can you describe her? Uh... she\\'s small... she\\'s a girl... Bingo! Oh Maggie! Not so fast! You\\'re wanted on three counts of criminal neglect. You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Ah, shucks. Just don\\'t do it again, you big lug. You\\'re not going anywhere. Hi, did you miss me? Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again. I missed you too. And from now on I hope you\\'ll help me out a little more than you\\'re used to. You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there? Well, I could use a little more. And sometimes I want a little time to myself, and I expect you to help -- Now, boys and girls, let\\'s welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company. Mom, I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about. Now let\\'s just try and get a little shut eye, okay? Hey, what gives? You said you wanted to live in a world without zinc, Jimmy. Well, now your car has no battery. But I promised Betty I\\'d pick her up by six. I\\'d better give her a call. Sorry Jimmy. Without zinc for the rotary mechanism, there are no telephones. Dear God, what have I done? Think again, Jimmy. You see, the firing pin in your gun was made of -- yup, zinc. Come back zinc! Come back... Come back... zinc. Come back... zinc. Zinc! Zinc! What? Oh, it was all a dream. Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones... car batteries... hand guns... And many things made of zinc. Gross, he\\'s picking his nose! If anyone wants to learn more about zinc, they\\'re welcome to stay... Ah, \"Chef Lonely Hearts\\' Soup For One.\" One scratch and win, Apu. Mrs. Krabappel, I haven\\'t seen you since we doubled our prices. Still teaching? Let\\'s see. One more day at least. Bingo! Bango! Sugar in the gas tank. Your ex-husband strikes again. Hmp. Hmp. \"A personal Ad?\" Why not? It might be fun, kind of a lark. C\\'mon, c\\'mon. Answer the phone. I need a man! Ow! My eyeball! People... people... Allllll right. You know I can wait just as long as you. Knock it off! Kids, this is a yo-yo. Kinda dull, huh? Not much competition for a video game. Or is it? Presenting, the Twirl King Champions! Mister Amazing! Sparkle! She\\'s beautiful! Zero Gravity! The Cobra! Those guys must be millionaires! I bet they get all kinds of girls! I question the educational value of this assembly. Hey, it\\'ll be one of their few pleasant memories when they\\'re pumpin\\' gas for a living. THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS! AGE OF AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! Now, for our next stunt, what do you say we get your Principal up here! No. Mmm... careful now...ooh... gee that one grazed my ear... Don\\'t move. You could really get hurt. Oh. How much do those yo-yos cost? I don\\'t care! Good-bye! Bye! Bye! Wow, thanks Sparkle. Wait, this isn\\'t you. That\\'s the old Sparkle. All right! Get your worthless butts in the van! We\\'ve got three more schools to do. Come on lets go go go. That\\'s your trick? No. Here\\'s my trick! Thank you. Thank you. Marge. Come here. Can you believe it? Pretty soon I\\'ll be able to quit my job and live off the boy. What? Name me one person who\\'s gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks. After two months at sea, the Pilgrims were running out of food and water... Yes Nelson? Did they have any yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos. When they landed at Plymouth rock they were greeted by the friendly Wampanoag Indians.... Did the Indians have yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos. That\\'s it. I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos. From now on I will not accept any book reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yos or yo-yo related topics. Am I making myself clear? Yo. Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today? Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle. I build up a little steam, and... I didn\\'t do it. Don\\'t worry about your wee fish, Lass. They\\'re going to a better place. Bart, that\\'s one month\\'s detention. Mrs. Krabappel, we\\'re all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back... Bart, if I were you, and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo? Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding. Well, would you? Absolutely. What\\'s eatin\\' you, woman? Your personal ad said you wanted a man. Well, you got yourself a humdinger. I don\\'t know. I guess I expected something different from your photo. Don\\'t let my age fool you. Just cause there\\'s a little snow on the roof... I forget how the rest of that goes. Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch? One months detention... She\\'ll pay for this. Yup, there\\'s your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here. Edna, happy hour in the Teacher\\'s Lounge. Just a sec. Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object: save me. Write Edna K, Box 402. Hmmm. Dear Edna, I\\'ve never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is... ...Woodrow. I like holding hands and dinner by candle light. And oh, yes, I really hate yo-yos. Oh, Woodrow. Maybe we should let the dog in? Marge, dogs love the outdoors. I think he needs a dog house. Yeah, but what\\'re ya gonna do? I\\'ll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars. Marge, you\\'re a tool of the dog house makers. I am not! Yes you are. You\\'ve been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I\\'ll build him a dog house. Oh, I don\\'t know... Don\\'t worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it. This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see. How was detention today, dear? Oh, not bad. I\\'m starting to get the hang of the floor waxer. Yes! \"Dear Woodrow, I must admit I\\'m intrigued. You\\'re not like the other men I\\'ve met.\" Yeah. I\\'m the 28th President of the United States. Mmm! Could it be there\\'s a special someone you\\'re not telling me about? Oh, please. \"But I\\'ve had some bad experiences with these ads. So, I\\'d like to learn more about you. Please write back soon. Here\\'s a photo that\\'ll get your pencil moving.\" You\\'ve got a date with a xerox machine. Stupid lumber... Dammit! Son of a -- The hell with this! Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down. Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables? Hell no! What did you say? I said I don\\'t want any damn vegetables. All right, that\\'s it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight. Weren\\'t you a little hard on him? Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me. Ned Flanders is on the phone. If this is about that stupid quarter again -- Hello, Ned. Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I\\'m kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn\\'t want to eat his \"damn vegetables.\" Well, you know kids and vegetables. What was it, asparagus? No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word. Oh, oh right, yeah. Kids usually pick these things up from someplace. Find out who\\'s doing it and... uh, direct them to the Bible. Where in the Bible? Uh... page nine-hundred. But Reverend... Damn Flanders. Hey, Lis, a moment of your time. Yeah? Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say? Is it Terri? Is it that exchange student Mx!pa? No! It\\'s not for me. It\\'s homework. Sure it is. Hey Bart, let\\'s do some homework. Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can\\'t fix your jeep. But maybe this will make it up to you. Galveston, oh Galveston... Is this all he watches? Oh, he used to watch \"Davy and Goliath,\" but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous. Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you? Of course I saved them. Although actually there\\'s only one. And it\\'s more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited. \"Maybe it\\'s the beer talking, Marge, but you\\'ve got a butt that won\\'t quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here.\" Wow, a side of dad I\\'ve never seen. Penny for your thoughts, Mrs. K. I was just thinking... oh, you wouldn\\'t be interested. Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk. Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who... likes the way I look first thing in the morning... laughs at my jokes... Uh-huh. ...can fix my car... Oh yeah. Dear Edna: Your photo took my breath away. \"Truly, yours is a butt that won\\'t quit. Yesterday morning, I put your picture up in my garage to inspire me while I gapped my spark plugs...\" At last we\\'ve built the mission. Finally, the villagers have a place to pray. Bringing in the Sheaves. Bringing in the Sheaves. \"We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the Sheaves.\" He\\'s not getting it from his brother, that\\'s for darn sure. Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt! Homer? What is it, Flanders? I\\'m afraid I have a bone to pick with you. Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay? No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth. What the hell are you talking about? Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don\\'t want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn\\'t curse in front of my boys. Oh come on now, Flanders, I don\\'t complain about your your... moustache. What\\'s wrong with my moustache? Makes you look like you\\'ve got something to hide. What? People are talking... lots of people. Okay, mister, you\\'ve got yourself a deal. I\\'ll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay? Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead. We now return to \"Two for Tunsia\" on Colorization Theater. Ah, my love... A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty. Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold. Wow, \"a million poets working for a million years\"... You\\'re so lucky. When are you gonna meet him? First, I asked him to send a photo. Uh... huh. If he\\'s got everything where it should be, I\\'m reelin\\' him in. Strap on your skates Gordie, you\\'re going in. Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you\\'re not laughing. Well, you know, maybe he\\'s right. Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don\\'t bring up your hero, Ned Flanders? Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word -- Look, we\\'re past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that\\'s the way God made me. And I\\'m too old to stop now. No, you\\'re not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think? Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar. Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer? Yes, Homer. What if I catch on fire? No, Homer. What if I see something really weird in the sky? Yes, Homer. What about when we snuggle? Uh... that\\'s okay. \"Dear Woodrow, it\\'s time for us to meet. Why don\\'t we go out to dinner and afterward we can go to my apartment for some home cookin\\'.\" Huh? Aye carumba! ...Hungrily yours, Edna.\" Well, she\\'s dangled on the line long enough. It\\'s time to boat this bass. When I read your letters, I feel as if you are right here watching me... Bart! Eyes down. Yes, ma\\'am. \"Edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles...\" \"Join me at the Gilded Truffle this Saturday at eight. Perhaps later we will smooch up a storm. Sexily yours, Woody.\" I can\\'t help but feel partly responsible. Homer, that was a twenty. God -- Ohh, you son-of-a. Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial. Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it\\'s almost criminal. You dirty bas... What do ya think, Lisa? How\\'s the dog supposed to get in? Well, he just goes... Ohhh Oh, Woodrow. How could you stand me up? Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you don\\'t need him. There are plenty of good men around. Name one. What\\'s wrong with Principal Skinner? Seymour? Huh, let\\'s just say his mommy won\\'t let him out to play. What about Coach Fortner? Glug, glug, glug, glug... Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie? I\\'m not even gonna tell you what that guy\\'s into. Bart, you\\'re the closest thing to a man in my life. And that\\'s so depressing, I think I\\'m gonna cry. Oh fudge, that\\'s broken. Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I\\'m not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down. Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse. Where\\'d you get the money? There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there\\'s a little surprise. Maggie. Oh. Cute. No, behind her. Beer! How did you know? Where\\'s Maggie? Where\\'s Maggie? There\\'s Maggie! Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life. Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart. I knew it. All right, Bart, who\\'s your girlfriend? Mrs. Krabappel. Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night. Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing. Boy, you\\'ve got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth. No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her. Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that\\'s what you wanted to hear. Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved. Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty. \"Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you.\" We\\'ll all help. \"Though I\\'ll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you.\" That sucks. How \\'bout, \"Crocodiles bit off my face.\" That\\'s disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn\\'t matter that a crocodile bit off his face. I may hold you to that, Marge. \"Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor.\" \"I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live.\" Three simple words. I am gay. Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in. \"And any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna!\" Oh, that\\'s very good, Lisa. P.S. -- I am gay. How shall we end it? How about, \"With a love that will echo through the ages?\" Oh, that\\'s sweet. Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper. Why you little... Wait! Wait! \"Dearest Edna, I must leave you. Why I cannot say. Where? You cannot know. How I will get there, I haven\\'t decided yet. But one thing I can tell you, any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna.\" Bart, it\\'s such a nice day today. Let\\'s have detention outside. It\\'s a date. Mmm, do - nuts. Hey Homer, slow down. You\\'re gonna choke or somethin\\'. Don\\'t tell me how to eat donuts -- Hey, Homer\\'s choking again. Hmm. Isn\\'t there a first aid chart around here somewhere? Somebody scare him. That\\'s for hiccups. Hey, look at this. Softball starts this week. Softball? Who\\'s next? What\\'s the matter with you guys? Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight. Look, I know it wasn\\'t our best season. Actually, it was. Well, this year\\'s gonna be different. Oh yeah. What makes you so damn sure? I have a secret weapon. Hey, he\\'s been holding\\' out on us. A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be. Come here boy, I want to show you something. What\\'s that? A home-made bat? It\\'s something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house... Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find. Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of. I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world\\'s greatest bat. Homie, come to bed. Homer, go back to the garage. And here it is. Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that? Let\\'s see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand. Hit one here, Charlie. Okay, let\\'s go over the ground rules. You can\\'t leave first until you chug a beer. Any man scoring has to chug a beer. You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd numbered innings. Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning. Hey, we know how to play softball. Play ball! Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at... Turn off that damn radio! And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy. Uh, Mom, why don\\'t you let me call the game. That\\'s all right dear. I can do it. Hey, stop that! Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you\\'re up. Where\\'s that secret weapon? Check it out, boys. My magic bat. Yeah, I got a magic bat, too. And I got an enchanted jock strap. Yeah, just watch. Woo hoooooo! Ha ha. Cops can\\'t win! Get his license and registration. Right, Chief. Wow, Dad. Homer, can I get you a beer? No, I want to get him a beer. Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let\\'s see it again in super slow motion. Such a mighty wallop. Hey, I got my magic bat off a piano. My sister let me use her wooden leg. Good news, sir! The plant\\'s softball team has won again. If we beat Shelbyville next week we capture the pennant. Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub and the title is ours. Ha!! My gladiators from my power plant will crush your team like nine flabby grapes. I disagree. Would you care to bet a million dollars on that? Oh, if we\\'re going to bet, why don\\'t we make it interesting? What? A million dollars isn\\'t interesting to you? Oh, did you say a million? I\\'m... I\\'m sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine. Um-hm. Smithers, I\\'ve been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet? Yes, sir. Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat in order to win a million dollar bet? No, sir! Whom should I kill? I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry! No, Smithers. I\\'ve decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers. We\\'ll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown... Uh... sir... What is it, Smithers? I\\'m afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years. Damnation! All right, find me some good players. Living players! Scour the professional ranks. The American League. The National League. The Negro Leagues. I\\'m on my way, sir. Oh, and Smithers... You have twenty-four hours. I get $50,000 to play one game? That\\'s right, Mr. Canseco. Well, it\\'s a pay cut. But what the hey, it sounds like fun. Ow. Hey, sorry! I thought you were a deer. That\\'s okay, happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia? That\\'s me. Uh, how do you like working for the Dodgers? Well, it\\'s okay. But sometimes I wish I had something a little more blue collar. You know, with big machines and cool dials and stuff, like an oil refinery or a hydro-electric plant. We should talk. And this is Elvis\\' rec room. When the King wasn\\'t rehearsing or exercising, he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once. Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle. Excuse me, are you Ozzie Smith? Yes. I have a proposition for you... Hello, are you Don Mattingly? Yes, yes I am. Come in. Come in. Can I get you something? What\\'s your name? How would you like to be a ringer on a small town company softball team? Would I! And now I\\'d like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family. Our new security guard... Roger Clemens... Hello. our new janitor, Wade Boggs... How you doin\\'? our new lunchroom cashier... Ken Griffey, Jr.... Hey, what\\'s up guys? Our new, well uh, we\\'ll make up jobs for these fellows later... Please say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose Canseco. Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there\\'s a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play. Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Burns. With them on the team, you won\\'t need us! Well... duh. You, Scioscia, sign up... Thanks just the same, but I\\'m here to run the solid contaminant encapsulator. One more outburst like that and I\\'ll send you back to the big leagues! You\\'re Darryl Strawberry. Yes. You play right field. Yes. I play right field too. So? Well, are you better than me? Well, I\\'ve never met you, but... yes. It\\'s not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we\\'ll be sitting on a bench. You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you? Marge, forget it. He\\'s bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do. You make me sick Homer. You\\'re the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it. Well now that you\\'re a little bit older, I can tell you that\\'s a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there\\'s always about a million people better than you. Gotcha. Can\\'t win, don\\'t try. As your new manager, I want to say this up front. No one is assured a spot in the starting line-up. I don\\'t care if your name is Steve Sax, Darryl Strawberry, or... Smithers, what\\'s one of the bad players\\' names? Homer Simpson, sir. Or Homer Simpson. Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this! It\\'s a brain and nerve tonic. Rich in proteids and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. Of course, it has been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases. Try some. Wow! It\\'s like there\\'s a party in my mouth and everyone\\'s invited. Excellent. Now, let\\'s begin our training, shall we? Smithers -- the medicine balls. What are you going to do with your million dollars, sir? Oh, I don\\'t know. Throw it on the pile, I suppose. You are all very good players. We are all very good players. You will beat Shelbyville. We will beat Shelbyville. You will give one hundred and ten percent. That\\'s impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give. I got it! I got it! Yes! Hey, I called for that! Put a lid on it, Simpson. There\\'s no \"I\" in \"team\". Some of these guys have a bad attitude, skip. They sure do, Strawberry. Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.? No. Hey Scioscia, I don\\'t get it. You\\'re a ringer but you\\'re here every night, in the core, bustin\\' your butt haulin\\' radioactive waste. Well Carl, it\\'s such a relief from the pressures of playing big league ball. I mean, there you make any kind of mistake and boom, the press is all over you. Uh-oh. Ah, don\\'t worry about it. Oh man, is this ever sweet. Pick me! Pick me! I pick Ken Griffey Jr. Aw geez... okay, I\\'ll take Milhouse. Hey, Mr. Boggs! Will you be on my team? You got yourself a player. Damn! All right, I\\'ll take Lewis. I\\'ll take Jose Canseco. Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns! What sideburns? You heard me, hippy. Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns. What sideburns? You heard me, hippie. These guys aren\\'t so tough. I\\'ve got \"Wonder Bat.\" Take a knee boys. Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop. Sure do, Skip. Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I\\'m very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let\\'s call it heart. No hustle either, Skip. That\\'s right, Darryl. Aw, nuts! Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team? You sure did. Sorry, I didn\\'t mean to get your hopes up. Smithers, there\\'s no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that\\'s possible. Seven misfortunes, there\\'s an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I\\'d like to see that. What a nice little town. Maybe I\\'ll buy a home here when I retire. What seems to be the problem, officers? That\\'s enough out of you, smart guy. Reach for your license... slowly. Well well, Steve Sax from New York City. I heard some guy got killed in New York City, and they never solved the case. But you wouldn\\'t know anything about that -- now would you Steve? But there\\'s hundreds of unsolved murders in New York City. You don\\'t know when to keep your mouth shut, do you Saxy boy? Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm. Can\\'t... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate. Well, I\\'m afraid you have a case of acute radiation poisoning, Mr. Scioscia. Will... I... be... able... to... play... softball... tomorrow? No, by tomorrow you\\'ll barely be able to breathe. Oh... man. Dr. Hibbert, Ken Griffey, Jr. needs to see you immediately. We think it\\'s an overdose of nerve tonic. Good Lord! Gigantism! My baby! My baby! Don\\'t worry, ma\\'am -- I\\'ll save your baby. Oh, thank you, Mr. Conseco. My cat! Never fear, ma\\'am! I\\'ll save your cat! My player piano! Oh, man. One thing I\\'m good at and I can\\'t do it anymore. Oh, Homie. You\\'re good at lots of things. Like what? Like snuggling... Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me. And I say, England\\'s greatest Prime Minister was Lord Palmerston. Pit the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Pit the Elder! Okay, you asked for it, Boggs! Yeah, that\\'s showin\\' him, Barney. Pit the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Nice work, boys. I think we can close the book on just about every unsolved crime in our fair city. Don\\'t I at least get to call my lawyer? You watch too many movies, Sax. How long does it take to see this thing? I\\'m kind of in a hurry. Well, it\\'s hard to say, my friend. Once you go in, you may never come out. Wow! One please. Where do you think you\\'re going? To the game. No, no, no! I don\\'t want you to see me sitting on my butt. We\\'ve seen it, dad. Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns! Look, Mr. Burns. I don\\'t know what you think sideburns are, but... Don\\'t argue with me! Just get rid of them. Smithers, it\\'s almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers? Sir, Mike Socioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth. What about Conseco? The dryer goes on the right. Yes ma\\'am. What about Clemens? Sir... he\\'s in no condition to play. Brock, bock, bock, bock. Brock, bock, bock, bock. That damn hypnotist! You, look what you\\'ve done! My starting pitcher thinks he\\'s a chicken! Make no mistake, I\\'m going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association. But I did a good job... a gooood job. Oh well, I guess it\\'s not your fault... you did a good job. Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You\\'re off the team! For good! Fine. I still like him better than Steinbrenner. All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you\\'re all I\\'ve got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win! Not so fast, Simpson. The man who plays your position is still here. Hit the pine. You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer! Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl. Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl. Children, that\\'s not very nice. Mom, they\\'re professional athletes. They\\'re used to this sort of thing. It rolls right off their backs. All right, Monty, it\\'s up to you managerial skills. What to do. Smithers, massage my brain. Yes, sir. You! Strawberry, hit a home run. Okay, Skip! I told him to do that. Brilliant strategy, sir. Oh, dear. Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids? We\\'ll tell ya, mom. All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up... They\\'re gonna win the championship, no thanks to me. Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I\\'m putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you. What? You\\'re pinch-hitting for me? Yes. You see, you\\'re a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it\\'s called playing the percentages. It\\'s what smart managers do to win ballgames. But I\\'ve got nine home runs today. You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You\\'re batting for Strawberry. I am? Whoo-hoo! Atta boy, Homer. You can do it. Brock, bock, bock, bock, bock! All right, Simpson, let\\'s go over the signals. If I tug the bill of my cap like so... Yes. ...it means the signal is a fake. Uh uh. However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly. Got it. If I want you to bunt, I will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice... Got that Simpson? Yes, sir! Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson. Huh? Oh, dear. No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game. Ohh, well, I guess he\\'ll be happy when he comes to. We won! We won! All right! Lurleen. WELL MR. BURNS HAD DONE IT / THE POWER PLANT HAD WON IT / WITH ROGER CLEMENS CLUCKING ALL THE WHILE / MIKE SOCIOSCIA\\'S TRAGIC ILLNESS MADE US SMILE / WHILE WADE BOGGS LAY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE BARROOM TILE / WE\\'RE TALKIN\\' SOFTBALL / FROM MAINE TO SAN DIEGO / TALKIN\\' SOFTBALL / MATTINGLY AND CONSECO / KEN GRIFFEY\\'S GROTESQUELY SWOLLEN JAW / STEVE SAX AND HIS RUN IN WITH THE LAW / WE\\'RE TALKIN\\' HO-MER / OZZIE AND THE STRAW / WE\\'RE TALKIN\\' SOFTBALL / FROM MAINE TO SAN DIEGO / TALKIN\\' SOFTBALL / MATTINGLY AND CONSECO / KEN GRIFFEY\\'S GROTESQUELY SWOLLEN JAW / STEVE SAX AND HIS RUN IN WITH THE LAW / WE\\'RE TALKIN\\' HO-MER / OZZIE AND THE STRAW..... Wait till next year. If I\\'m still alive. Good one, Lenny. Magnificent, simply magnificent. You from outta town? Yes. Have you been to the Museum of Barnyard Oddities yet? No! Where is it? Oh, here, gimme the map. I\\'ll show you. Like this, Skip? Oh, you\\'re a manager\\'s dream, Strawberry. Smithers, it\\'s almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers? Sir, Mike Scioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth. Now, class, I promised you a surprise today... Wow. I knew it. ...And here it is. We\\'re going to take a test. We\\'re going to take a test. All right! A test! It\\'s called the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test, or \"CANT\". Some of you may discover a wonderful vocation you never even imagined. Others may find out life isn\\'t fair. In spite of your Masters from Bryn-mawr, you might end up a glorified baby-sitter to a bunch of dead-eyed fourth graders while your husband runs naked on a beach with your marriage counselor. Well, that was a waste of time. Janey, school is never a waste of time. Since we have fifteen minutes until recess, please put down your pencils and stare at the front of the room. Here for the tests. C\\'mon Emma. Here\\'s your scientifically selected career -- Architect. Mm, hm. Insurance salesman. Mm, hm. Salmon gutter? Military strongman. Systems analyst systems analyst systems analyst... Systems analyst. Awriigght! Homemaker?! Mm, hmm. It\\'s like a Mommy. Police officer? Well, I\\'ll be jiggered. If you\\'d like to learn more I could arrange for you to ride along in a police car for a night. Hey, I don\\'t need you to get me in the back of a police car. Ohhh, nooo. Coppppss. I really think you should consider this. You know, before I saw these test results I had you pegged as a drifter. Wow, a drifter. Cool. A homemaker! I might as well be dead! Lisa, it\\'s not that bad. So what\\'re you gonna be, boy? Policeman. That\\'s nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy. No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb. Well, I\\'m gonna be a famous jazz musician. I\\'ve got it all figured out. I\\'ll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French. I\\'ll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but I do plan to have several torrid love affairs. And I may or may not die young, I haven\\'t decided. Honey, if that\\'s what you want, we\\'ll do anything we can to help. Wait a minute. Isn\\'t anybody gonna follow in my footsteps? Can you tell me if I have what it takes to be a blues musician? Sure can. Show me your chops. Uh huh... Yeah. Cool. So you think she has talent? Sure. Do you think she could be a professional some day? Oh, Lord no. But I\\'ll practice every day! Yeah, well I\\'ll be frank with you, Lisa. And when I say frank, I mean, you know, devastating. You\\'ve inherited a finger condition known as \"stubbiness\". It usually comes from the father\\'s side. Stupid fingers. You\\'re wrong, you\\'re wrong! You don\\'t need long fingers to play the blues. The blues come from in here! My God, they are stubby. Look, I didn\\'t steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it. No no, sir, we\\'re here to pick up your son. He\\'s coming on a ride-along. Good for you. Maybe this\\'ll straighten the boy out. Wow! Can I see your club? It\\'s called a baton, son. Oh, what\\'s it for? We club people with it. Well, it\\'s about time. So, you guys like being cops? Oh it\\'s great. You get to run red lights... Park wherever you please... Hot and cold runnin\\' chicks... And when you go home at night, you know you\\'ve made a difference. Hey Bart, you see that Caddy over there? Huh-huh. That\\'s Mayor Quimby\\'s car. Tonight Hizzoner is \"polling the electorate\". How would you like a street named after you? I tell ya, they only come out at night. Dear Log... This will be my last entry. For you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now I have none. Do you need straight A\\'s to be a cop? Hey, fellas, let\\'s go shoot some bad guys. Whoa, whoa, it doesn\\'t quite work that way, son. People see movies like \"McBain\" and they think it\\'s all bang-bang, shoot-\\'em-up, cops-n-robbers. Let\\'s roll! One ocean tango... We are in pursuit of a speeding individual, driving a red... ...car. License number... Eggplant-Xerxes-Crybaby-Overbite-Narwhal. Ooh, they used nylon rope this time. It feels so smooth against my skin. Almost sensuous. Oh, baby! Damn boxes! He\\'s trapped. Where\\'s our backup? I don\\'t know. Son, this is against every regulation, but would you cover us? Woww! See you in hell, punk. Act Two: \"Death Drives A Stick.\" See you in hell, punk. Man, that was close! Good thing this alley got so narrow in the middle. Well, that\\'s nice work, boys. Looks like you just bought yourself a lottery ticket... to jail. He\\'s unconscious, sir. They can still hear things! Sir, I know what I wanna be when I grow up. A cop! Well, until then, son, I\\'m gonna make you an honorary police officer... Eddie, give him your badge. Hey! Morning, honey. What\\'s so good about it.... Lisa, I know you\\'re down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. See, this morning I turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for Bart and Homer. What\\'s the point? They\\'ll never notice. Oh well, you\\'d be surprised. Now, just relax your hand. Thank you, Ma\\'am. You\\'ve been most cooperative. Bad dog! Very bad dog. Mom, before you blame the dog, I think you should take a look at these surveillance photos. Oh... Oh... Unng... Oh, Bart. Uh, I don\\'t know how that got in there. Lisa, why aren\\'t you at band practice? I quit. Oh, honey, right now you\\'re discouraged. But deep down, you know you love the saxophone. I think you should stay in the band. If you think it\\'s so great, why don\\'t you join the band? Lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can\\'t do. But they don\\'t always know what they\\'re talking about. The girl on the oatmeal box? Women can\\'t be astronauts. They\\'d distract the men astronauts so they wouldn\\'t keep their minds on the road. So you see, my sisters were wrong. Except about the cities on the moon. I was wrong about that. So... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong. Sweet vigilant puma. Principal of the mountains. Hi Lis, want to quiz me on the vowels? Janey, I\\'m about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet. Huh? Lisa, what are you doing? That\\'s the bad girl bathroom. A doy. You wanna egg his house? Okay. What\\'re you lookin\\' at? Nothin\\'. Then get out, \\'cause we\\'re figuring out stuff to egg. Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in. Really? I saw some awful things in \\'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I\\'d say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school! God, I could really use a half-day. Think you\\'re big men with your handcuffs and blasted tasers! Get him outta here. I\\'ll get you Bart Simpson, if it\\'s the last thing I do! Now what is this all about? Well, it\\'s quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws. Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy? That\\'s right, man. I got my first taste of authority... And I liked it. Hm. Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I can\\'t be everywhere at once. Go on. Look, let\\'s can the euphemisms, huh? No more bullspit. How would you like to be a hall monitor? Wouldn\\'t that mean squealing on other kids? That\\'s the meat of it, yes. Hmm. Now, Witness X, will you please tell the court what you saw? I\\'d be more than happy to. I saw Mr. Montone there seal the late Mr. Palacio in an oil drum and roll him off the pier. I keel you!! Aye carumba! Uh, I don\\'t know. Oooh, now, you get to wear a sash... You\\'ve got yourself a narc. Hey, Jimbo, keepin\\' your nose clean, dude? Attaboy! Hey, Donna, who loves ya, baby? Not in my hall, bub. Did you say one hundred and thirty million dollars? I think you\\'ve had enough, sister. C\\'mon, let\\'s keep it moving. Pink belly! Pink belly! Pink belly! Allright, break it up, boys. That belly ain\\'t gonna get any pinker. Okay. Wedgie! Oh! Thanks, Bart. Bart\\'s grades are up a little this term. But Lisa\\'s are way down. We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can\\'t both our kids be good? We have three kids, Homer. Maaarge... The dog doesn\\'t count as a kid. No, Maggie! Oh yeah. Now, take some paste and spread it on the construction paper. Ralph, are you eating your paste? No, Miss Hoover. Good. Now, sprinkle your sparkles on your paste. Lisa, you\\'re not sprinkling your sparkles. Shove it. I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against? Whattaya got? And she goes, \"Lisa told Hoover to shove it\" and I\\'m like, \"No way!\" And she\\'s like, \"Fraid so,\" and I\\'m all, \"Whooah!\", and she\\'s like... Hey, Lisa, man. I\\'m like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all \"Hi, there, I\\'m so good.\" Want a smoke? Uh, I\\'ll smoke it in class. Whoa. Bart, you\\'re doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you\\'d just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere. Every day is a new fight, sir. Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion. Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me. Madre de Dios! The legends were true! Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere. Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice. All-riight! Ooo, now, you be careful with that crossbow. I will. Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson\\'s mother. And this is Nelson\\'s English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d\\'s. Forgery. So he didn\\'t have leprosy. This is a great day for me. I thought I could never teach again. Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock. Hey Lewis, watch this. Ow! Bart, do something. Let\\'s go, Milhouse. Sure, we have order. But at what price! Now let\\'s correct our homework exercises. Lisa, what nineteenth century figure was nicknamed \"Old Hickory\"? I don\\'t know. You? Lisa, if you\\'d bothered to do the assignment you\\'d know the answer is... The Battle of New Orleans. I mean, Andrew Jackson. Well, you\\'re earning your eighteen grand a year. Stupid Hoover... thinks she\\'s so smart. She wouldn\\'t be so smart without her Teacher\\'s edition. Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher\\'s edition in this school. What\\'ll we do? Declare a snowday! Does anyone know the multiplication table? Please, please, don\\'t panic! They can smell fear. Children, I know this is highly irregular, but for the rest of the uh, day Martin will be teaching this class. I will? But I wouldn\\'t know where to begin. Just do it, Brainiac. Have I ever told you kids about the sixties? I\\'ve... got... to get... out... of... here! Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. I\\'m leaving the profession again. Oh now Mr. Glasscock, please reconsider. Hunh-uh. Bart, the police haven\\'t had any luck finding the teachers\\' editions. The dogs have picked up the scent of books. Send in the battering ram. Here we go! We\\'re going to have to re-order every book. Seymour, I\\'ll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker. Oh, Bart, I\\'m not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court... Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately? Let\\'s move. Hmm... Bah. Lisa. That\\'s right. It was I. Lis, why did you do it? Yeah, but even I had my limits. You\\'re looking at expulsion for this. I know. I know. The books! Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you\\'ve just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Who\\'s behind this monstrous crime? I am. I\\'ve been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor. Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker. D\\'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I\\'ve decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention. Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head. All right, five hundred days. Oooh, big man. Six hundred days. Maybe I\\'ll just shut my big mouth. Let\\'s go, Simpson. Bart, why\\'d you take the blame? \\'Cause I didn\\'t want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I\\'ll be right there to borrow money. Oh, Bart. Soundin\\' good, Lis! I don\\'t need your crummy job Mr. Employer! I won the lottery! Well, who needs employees? I won the lottery too! We both won the lottery! Why don\\'t you win the lottery, too? The State Lottery. Where everybody wins. Actual odds of winning -- one in three hundred eighty million. Pfft, the lottery. Exploiter of the poor and ignorant. You know, I heard the jackpot\\'s up to one hundred and thirty million dollars. One hundred and thirty million dollars! Yes, yes, here\\'s your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again. Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what\\'s your birthday? No kidding. And what\\'s Lisa\\'s birthday?... What? You don\\'t know your sister\\'s birthday? What kind of brother are you? Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It\\'s time for another bank run. All right, but if I don\\'t make it, promise you won\\'t sleep with my wife. I promise nothing. You\\'ll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery! But we never ever... I know you\\'re excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money... I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that\\'s enough excitement for me. You don\\'t understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you. Homer, we\\'re on a tight budget here. Promise me you won\\'t get carried away. Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery! Hey, down in front. The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever. And Springfield is no exception. In fact, every copy of Shirley Jackson\\'s \"The Lottery\" has been checked out from the Springfield Public Library. Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad. But there\\'s already one big winner. Our state\\'s school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery. You can still win some money if you have five out of six. Whoo-hoo! Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don\\'t have that Base six crap in them. And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets. Magnets. Always with the magnets. I\\'ve never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery. Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one. Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids? Put it in the bank. Give it to the poor. What do kids know about spending money? What are you gonna do, Homer? Hmm... Hey Homer, what\\'d you do? Get a haircut or something? Look closer, Lenny! Oh I know what it is. You\\'re the biggest man in the world now. And you\\'re covered in gold. Fourteen carat gold! Take a hike boss, I\\'m running things now. All hail king Homer! We now take you to the drawing live -- I hope you\\'ve got your tickets. I\\'ve got mine. They\\'re about to start, Chief. No, you\\'ve got the wrong number. This is nine one two. We\\'ll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket outta here, Mel. I will now draw the first winning number. I\\'ve got so many tickets I can\\'t lose! The first number is... seventeen. And the second number is... three. Receipts, ugh. Yeah, I knew we wouldn\\'t win. Well why didn\\'t you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we\\'d be rich! But no! You had to be \"10.\" And the final number is... forty-nine. Thirty-eight... forty-nine... Ohmigod! I won! I won! Recapping our day\\'s top story -- the winner of today\\'s state lottery is me, Kent Brockman! Can we get a shot of me? There you go. In other news... uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland... many people killed... uh... Goodbye. Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we\\'ve still got each other. Hey, the dog\\'s dead. Grampa, he\\'s not dead! Dad, you shouldn\\'t say the dog\\'s dead when he\\'s not. It\\'s not fair to toy with people\\'s emotions like that. He is dead! I\\'ll get a shovel. Well, he\\'s not dead, but he is awfully sick. Oh, sure! The old man\\'s off his rocker. If Grampa says he\\'s dead he must be alive. He is alive. He\\'s wagging his tail. That don\\'t mean nothin\\'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I\\'m tired of this conversation. Let\\'s talk about something else. I\\'m going home. Clear! Ugh... Clear! Doctor... he\\'s gone. This is the part of the job I hate. Hey, you did the best you could. I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can\\'t thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let\\'s see what\\'s wrong with this little fella. I\\'m afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he\\'ll die. Hmm, how much will it cost? Seven hundred and fifty dollars. Oh dear! This is never an easy decision. It\\'s an awful lot of money. Well... I guess we\\'ll have to talk it over. Talk what over? What\\'s there to talk about? What are we going to talk over? Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum. I can\\'t help but notice we\\'re leaving the hospital. When\\'s the dog going to get his operation? Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven. In Doggie Heaven, there\\'s mountains of bones and they can\\'t turn around without sniffing another dog\\'s butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and... Is there a Doggie Hell? Well... of course. There couldn\\'t be a heaven if there weren\\'t a hell. Who\\'s in there? Uh... Hitler\\'s dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester. Checkers. Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy. Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa\\'s Little Helper? Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can\\'t afford this operation. You\\'re gonna just let him die? I know you\\'re upset -- Darn right I\\'m upset! Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry. We are not going to let our dog die! And that\\'s IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa... But it\\'ll be okay... we\\'ll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach... Oh, come on! I\\'m sorry, but we just can\\'t afford it. Marge, make him stop. Thanks, Mom. All right. All right. We\\'ll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog. Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money. Please, do go on... I know you\\'re a good man... and I have a dog that\\'s very sick... Oh, please, continue... I thought maybe you... Oh. Well, thanks for your time. What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money? People like dogs, Mr. Burns. Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say? Uh... if YOU did it, sir?... Exactly! You\\'d be fit to be tied! Dogs! No. What? You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself. But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey. Maybe you\\'re right, Marge. I\\'ve found a way we can pay for the operation. Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam? No. I\\'m afraid we\\'re just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you\\'re going to have to give up beer for a while. Bart, from now on you\\'ll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College. No problemo. I\\'m going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night... ... will now be chub night. Chub? I don\\'t even know what that is! Lisa, I\\'m afraid we\\'ll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store. But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis. We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie\\'s baby clothes will have to last for a little longer... Marge, I\\'ve figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats... I don\\'t think you\\'ve thought this through. Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I\\'m afraid he\\'ll never fight again. That\\'s what you think. He\\'ll fight and he\\'ll win! Clamp. Wipe... No! No! Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There\\'s a good boy. Come on. Come on. Um... Simpson? It\\'s times like this I\\'m glad I flunked out of dental school. Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don\\'t? You wouldn\\'t want what he\\'s eating. It\\'s mostly just snouts and entrails. Mmm... snouts. Yes, I\\'m back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I\\'m a journalist. Well, he\\'s got all the money in the world, but there\\'s one thing he can\\'t buy. What\\'s that? A dinosaur. Of course I\\'m not the only one who benefited from last week\\'s big payoff. Our state\\'s schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser. One eraser? Oh, I\\'m used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three -- And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week\\'s forty-thousand dollar \"jackpot\": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29. Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn\\'t for that dog, I would\\'ve won! Class, for tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus. C\\'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don\\'t you? Keep singin\\'! BUFFALO GALS WON\\'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS... Who\\'s that old rummy? Before his dog got sick, that \"old rummy\" used to be my best customer. AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN! Go get it, pal. My quarter!!! Okay, I\\'ll just even this out and. Mr. Laswell! I\\'ve done it again. I know you can\\'t understand me, but you\\'re a lousy dog and I hate you. Not now. Can\\'t you see I\\'m reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station? Dumb dog. Homie, did you close the gate? Yes. Oh, you mean tonight. The dog will get out! Bart! Close the gate. Lisa! Close the gate. Close the gate, Maggie. Here boy! Here Santa\\'s Little Helper! It\\'s all my fault. I called him a dumb dog. Oh he\\'s gone and he\\'s never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that\\'s a horse. Have you found a picture yet? Not one that I want the public to see. ... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug. Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can\\'t wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon. Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you\\'ve got your running shoes on. That\\'s a good thing. What\\'s wrong with Crippler? He\\'s getting on, sir. He\\'s been here since the late sixties. Ah yes, I\\'ll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn\\'t think it was too \"groovy.\" I\\'m looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh. Why here\\'s the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me. Uh...the last one. Now! As an attack dog, you\\'ll be expected to neutralize intruders. Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies? If that were a real Girl Scout I\\'d have been bothered by now. I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. He\\'s in here somewhere. Now here\\'s a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy. Poor Santa\\'s Little Helper. I\\'m starting to think we\\'ll never see him again. That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that\\'s where he took a whiz on the rug. Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there\\'s no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven. Oh, Marge! There is no such place! Or... to put it another way... there is. I\\'m not giving up. I don\\'t care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I\\'m gonna find my dog. And I\\'ll be right here watching TV. Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Excellent! Hello, I\\'m Kent Brockman. Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog. Two tickets for... Let me guess. \"Look Who\\'s Oinking\"? Hmm huh. And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one. You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman. Homeless this, and hungry that. Gee, I\\'m sorry mister. Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy. Good. I, uh. I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir. But there\\'s a sweet little boy at the door. Release the hounds. Santa\\'s Little Helper! It\\'s you! AAAGGGHHH!! What\\'s the matter boy? Don\\'t you know me? I\\'m your buddy! I love ya, boy. Let me pet him again! You already petted him for ten minutes. I know. I want to pet him again! You can pet the cat. The cat? What\\'s the point? Look dad, there\\'s a spot. Oh, there\\'s a spot, dear. Oooh, there\\'s a good one. That spot says \"compact only\". Marge, that\\'s just a suggested car size. Easy... easy... How\\'m I doing on the right? Uh, we\\'re getting a lot of sparks over here, dad. Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window. Ooh, they all look great. So, what are we going to see? Ernest Cuts The Cheese! \"Honey, I Hit A School Bus\"! Look Who\\'s Oinking! \"Look Who\\'s Oinking\"! Well, since we\\'ll never agree, why don\\'t you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we\\'ll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm? That\\'s right. Sold out. Maybe we could see something a little more adult. Why Marge, you frisky little devil. We\\'ll take two tickets to \"The Stockholm Affair.\" Ooh! The paper called it a \"taut political thriller\". Political! Mr. President, disturbing news. Serious cracks are developing in the Greco-Bolivian Alliance. Get me Jed Kolick! Ah, this movie\\'s too complicated... Hey, the floor\\'s sticky... Who\\'s that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, \"Who\\'s that guy?\" Oh, that submarine\\'s so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus! What? If you don\\'t watch the violence, you\\'ll never get desensitized to it. Just tell me when the scary part\\'s over. It\\'s over. I think that guy\\'s a spy. Well of course he\\'s a spy. You just saw him go through spy school! Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter. Hey, it\\'s pretty obvious if you think about it. Oh, shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think! Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?... Forget it, mom. Dad\\'s really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck... And stress is collecting in the trouble spots here... here... and here... Making for one unhappy pappy. Homie, aren\\'t you coming inside? Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I\\'m going now and I don\\'t know when you\\'ll see me again. I guess that executive stress ball we got him for Christmas isn\\'t working. Mmm... Ew, a skunk! Oh no. Ooh, a redneck bar. Hey, you, let\\'s fight! Them\\'s fightin\\' words! Duff please. We don\\'t sell Duff. We sell Fudd. Okay, Fudd me. All right, all right, uh, ladies and gentlemen, he\\'s all healed up and he\\'s back for more. Let\\'s give a big drunken welcome to Yodelin\\' Zeke! Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee -- Arrgh! Our next act is our very own singin\\' waitress, Lurleen! ... So, I\\'m afraid drink service will stop for just a few moments while she -- They\\'re all yours. Stupid Marge tell me to shut up. Thank you. Tonight I\\'d like to try something a little different. It\\'s a song I wrote while I was moppin\\' up your dried blood and teeth. YOU WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ SWEAT AND BREAK YOUR BACK/ Yeah... THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR CASTLE/ BUT YOUR QUEEN WON\\'T CUT YOU SLACK/ ... that\\'s true. THAT\\'S WHY YOU\\'RE LOSIN\\' ALL YOUR HAIR/... THAT\\'S WHY YOU\\'RE OVERWEIGHT/... Uh-huh. THAT\\'S WHY YOU FLIPPED YOUR PICK-UP TRUCK RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE/... That\\'s right, except for the pick-up truck. Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they... Wha...wha... Wait a minute. You went to another bar? THERE\\'S A LOT OF BULL THEY HAND YOU/ THERE\\'S NOTHIN\\' YOU CAN DO/ YOUR WIFE DON\\'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ NO, YOUR WIFE DON\\'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU/ BUT I DO/ Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I\\'ve gotta say somethin\\' to ya. I\\'m listenin\\'. Your song touched me in a way I\\'ve never felt before. And which way to the can? So what\\'s your name, stranger? Homer J. Simpson. My name\\'s Lurleen Lumpkin. That\\'s a pretty name. Oh, you think so? Maybe. I\\'m not sure. I forgot it. Bye Lurleen. So long, Homer J. Simpson. Y\\'ello. Where were you all night? I was just up at this bar in Spittle County. You should have called. I was very worried. Marge, let\\'s end this feudin\\' and a fussin\\' and get down to some lovin\\'. I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/ Doctor, you weren\\'t supposed to remove his gall bladder. Put it back! Put it back! YOUR WIFE DON\\'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO... Gheee... Homer\\'s singing to his ball again. Yeah, and he\\'s bowling a two-eighty. Oh yeah. THERE\\'S A KIND OF HUSH/ ALL OVER THE WORLD TONIGHT... Hey Moe, you got any Fudd? Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind. Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town. Oh, Homer. Well, if it isn\\'t Homer J. Simpson. Lurleen, I can\\'t get your song outta my mind. I haven\\'t felt this way since \"Funky Town.\" Oh, aren\\'t you sweet. Do you think I could get a copy of it? Sorry, darlin\\', all my songs are up here. \"I\\'m Bastin\\' a Turkey With My Tears\", \"Don\\'t Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It\", \"I\\'m Sick of Your Lyin\\' Lips and False Teeth\"... Lurleen, we\\'ve gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs! Well, I don\\'t know. Come with me! Oh! I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU, BUT I DOOO. Listen ma\\'am, my brother owns a radio station over in Weevilville, and with your permission, I\\'d like to take your CD to him. Homer, it\\'s your quarter, what do you say? I guess so. This is K-U-D-D five seventy A.M. Hey, don\\'t touch that dial -- you\\'ve got KUDD on it. For the next half hour, beer\\'s on the house. What\\'d you say, Moe? Nothin\\'. I thought I told you to stay away from my sister! Oh, here\\'s fifty bucks. Take her to the Copa. It\\'s payback time! Aww... puts this whole riot into perspective, doesn\\'t it? She\\'s wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit. Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ\\'s whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all. Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think? Well, it\\'s nice. But who is this woman? Well, right now she\\'s an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she\\'s going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady. I don\\'t like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress! Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits. Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife. Oh Homer, everybody\\'s been callin\\'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you. Don\\'t thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain. Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin\\' somethin\\' in return. Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it. Homer, you\\'re just a big sack of sugar. Thanks. You did say sugar, right? Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager. Really? Well, I should warn you... I\\'m not great with figures... That\\'s okay. I make a lot of stupid decisions... Nobody\\'s perfect. I did bad in school. I didn\\'t even go. My personal hygiene has been described as... Homer, Homer, you\\'ll be a great manager. There\\'s only one thing you need. Now this is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit! Marge, look at me. I don\\'t want to. I\\'m mad at you. I\\'m sick of that waitress and all the time you\\'ve been spending with her, and this whole country music thing. Uh, then maybe you better not look at me. Homer! Where did you get that suit? A friend bought it for me. Was it Lurleen? No... I think it was Lenny. Don\\'t lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman? No! Have you kissed her? No! Has she kissed you? A coupla times. I want you to stop seeing her. I can\\'t. I\\'m her manager. Her manager? That\\'s ridiculous. I won\\'t allow you to spend any more time away from your family. Marge, you\\'re standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer. Your boyhood dream was to eat the world\\'s biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember? Marge, Lurleen\\'s gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I\\'m going to be there. Fine. See if I care. This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, \"There is no way in hell that I\\'m gonna record in this dump\". I\\'m sure Lurleen will love it. Homer, how much did you just give that man? Calm down, Marge, it\\'s just our life savings. I\\'m not going to go into hock for this. Hey, Colonel Homer. And you must be... Mrs. Homer Simpson. Charmed. Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight! Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. What does that mean? I\\'M ASKIN\\' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT? I don\\'t have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people! Well, c\\'mon boys. Let\\'s break some hearts. OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY ON THE DIAMOND OF MY HEART/ WHEN THE COACH CALLED ME UP TO THE PLATE/ I\\'D BEEN SWINGIN\\' AND MISSIN\\' AND LOVIN\\' AND KISSIN\\'/ MY AVERAGE WAS POINT DOUBLE AUGHT EIGHT/ SO I SPIT ON MY HANDS/ KNOCKED THE DIRT FROM MY SPIKES/ AND POINTED RIGHT TOWARD CENTER FIELD/ THIS TIME I\\'M HITTIN\\' A HOME RUN/ THIS TIME LOVE IS FOR REAL/ I\\'LL SLIDE, I\\'LL STEAL, Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo? Stop it. I\\'LL SACRIFICE/ A LOVING FLY FOR YOU/ I\\'VE BEEN SLUMPING ALL SEASON/ BUT NOW I\\'VE FOUND A REASON/ I STRUCK ON A LOVE THAT IS TRUE/ I USED TO PLAY THE FIELD/ I USED TO BE A ROAMER/ BUT THE SEASON\\'S TURNIN\\' \\'ROUND FOR ME NOW/ I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER. THAT\\'S RIGHT! I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER. Lurleen, we\\'re gonna have to cut you off. We\\'re getting some kind of grinding noise on the track. You, off the bench. Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV. Oh Homer! You\\'re as smart as you are handsome. Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new. Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up. Let\\'s hear it. IN THIS TRAILER, I GET SO COLD AND LONELY/ LYIN\\' THERE AWAKE AT NIGHT/ MUTTERING IF ONLY YOU WEREN\\'T MARRIED/ SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ OH BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ I\\'M ASKIN\\' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT? Oh, that\\'s hot. There isn\\'t a man alive who wouldn\\'t get turned on by that. Well, g\\'bye. Uh, Homer, there\\'s a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. Really listen. BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT... Uh-huh... BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT... Right... That\\'s right Homer J. Uh... I gotta think about this. All our money\\'s tied up in this woman. If she fails, we\\'re broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don\\'t know what to root for. You don\\'t? I gotta go. Homer... Later, Marge. Lurleen\\'s on TV tonight. I gotta get ready. Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth. That\\'s great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband? You\\'re not even listening to me! Sure they will. Kids, will you come in here? You\\'ve got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don\\'t forget it when you walk out that door tonight. Uh... I gotta go. As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit. Hold onto your pitch forks everybody! It\\'s time again for... Ya - hooooooo! Starring, in alphabetical order... Yodelin\\' Zeke... Butterball Jackson... Freddy-boy and Yuma... Cloris Mozelle... Big Shirtless Ron... Orville and Hurley... Cathy May... Hip Diddler... Rooney!... ... The Ya-Hoo Recovering Alcoholic Jug Band... and tonight, in her syndicated TV debut... Lurleen! OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY... Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson? Yes I am. I\\'m from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I\\'m interested in buying Lurleen\\'s contract. Forget it, pal. They don\\'t call me Colonel Homer because I\\'m some dumb-ass army guy. Lurleen, they loved you. Well thank you -- I\\'m still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay. Is there anything you need? I\\'m sorry? Well... you could make my evening complete. What\\'s wrong? My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes. Gross! Thanks for dinner! No! At least could I have my dollar ba... I\\'ll love you for the rest of my life. I\\'m sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I\\'ve done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family. Just so I don\\'t wonder... You would\\'ve gone all the way with me, wouldn\\'t you? Uh-huh. Okay. Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I\\'m desperate to unload Lurleen. And I\\'ll take any offer. I\\'ll give you fifty bucks. You son of a... Sold! I caught my wife in bed with my best friend. You bitter? Yeah. Bit him too. And now, once again, Lurleen. Homer? Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool? Always has been. Now I\\'d like to play a song I wrote just this minute. It\\'s called \"Stand By Your Manager\". HIS NAME IS HOMER/ HE\\'S QUITE A MAN/ I TRIED TO KISS HIM/ BUT HOMER RAN. SURE WISH I COULD SAY/ THAT I WAS HIS/ I HOPE THAT MARGE KNOWS/ JUST HOW LUCKY SHE IS. I do. Would you turn off that rock \\'n\\' rock music! Hey, don\\'t have a Stegosaurus, man. These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV. Look Maggie, they have a baby, too. It\\'s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen. Now kids, I know you\\'re all excited about meeting Aunt Selma\\'s new boyfriend tonight. Pfft. But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. Something... disturbing. Ewww. Ooooh. Bleuh. You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie\\'s a jailbird. Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray. Now, now, he\\'s an ex-convict. He\\'s paid his debt to society. Then how come you\\'re not using the good silverware? I\\'m just not. That\\'s them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity. Everyone, I\\'d like you to meet -- Sideshow Bob! What the...? Selma dear, I\\'m afraid the children\\'s reaction is quite understandable. You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison. That\\'s right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery. Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I\\'d find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton. Lousy snitch. Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you\\'re forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha. I am not. Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children\\'s programming. When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination... Don\\'t be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum. Then call me Mrs. Scum! When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children\\'s program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life. And the Emmy goes to... I don\\'t believe this. Sideshow Bob. This is one more Emmy than you\\'ll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box! Just don\\'t drop that thing in the shower, Bob. No-talent shill! Second banana! Panderer! Bore! Stop it, stop... release me... . Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer... Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts. Who used my chapstick? Oh, I did. Here you go. I don\\'t want it. My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there... Aye-Carumba! Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I\\'d have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door. But then what kind of a guest would I have been? Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb. You can\\'t take my Emmy! Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe. But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program. White. Knock it off. Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am. Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart. Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles. Selma, may I? Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek. Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be. I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved. Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I\\'m going to miss you most of all. What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You\\'re living proof that our revolving door prison system works. Selma, I\\'ve never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl. I\\'ve got to admit it, Selma. He\\'s a once in a lifetime catch. Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well. I can\\'t believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown. Bart! Indeed, I did. And I\\'d like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma. Hear hear!. Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family? All right, but no tongues. Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that\\'s not what I had in mind. Selma, will you marry me? I suppose so. I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME. AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE\\'S A CHANCE YOU WON\\'T BE LEAVIN\\' WITH ME. THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO. AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN\\' SOMETHIN\\' STUPID LIKE \"I LOVE YOU\". Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me? Avec plaisir. A... G... Q... Seven... Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love. We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness. Tiffany! Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys. So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in What\\'s next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I\\'m talking about. Get out here, you goombah! Krusteleh, there\\'s an old friend backstage who wants to say hello. Huh? Whuh? Come here you. Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you. Oh, I missed ya. This guy is a national treasure. That jerk I got to replace you, he isn\\'t fit to hold your slide whistle. All I can be is myself. Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail? Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I\\'m right back in there. That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony. Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too. Oh Krusty, I can\\'t tell you how much I missed this. Now, about your wedding dress. I\\'m not sure how to put this... White. And what would you like for appetizers? Oooh, appetizers. Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve? Well, you can\\'t go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain\\'t ketchup! Well, Selma, he makes a good case. Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me. Selma, dear -- I\\'m confused. Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell. Okay, we\\'ve got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs. Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I\\'ve already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison. Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled. Selma, that\\'s wonderful. I just hope people don\\'t think I\\'m marrying you for your money, instead of your... less tangible qualities. Tomorrow we\\'ll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn\\'t it grand? Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way. Holy frijoles! We\\'ve got ten minutes till MacGyver! Driver, here\\'s a fin. Get me home and don\\'t spare the whip. Whatever you say, mum. What did I miss? MacGyver was wearing a tank top. Dang. Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life. Sit down and shut up. Thank you, SeÃ±or MacGyver. You saved our village. Don\\'t thank me. Thank the moon\\'s gravitational pull. That MacGyver\\'s a genius. Ah, that\\'s sweet. First of all he\\'s not a genius, he\\'s an actor. And second, he\\'s not much of an actor. You\\'re lying! You\\'re lying! No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch. He was so cruel... The things he said, they\\'re just not true. There, there... Oh well, I guess the wedding\\'s off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow\\'s another day. Bart! Stop that. No, he\\'s right. We\\'re a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding\\'s off. Selma, I don\\'t know what to say. Just tell me you like MacGyver. Very well. I... I... I can\\'t do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on. Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it\\'s no big deal. You know why? Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love. Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I\\'ll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever. Oh Bob. Bart no like. Bad medicine. I could\\'ve been the flower girl. And I wouldn\\'t keep falling down either. Hey, they chose Maggie, okay? Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine. Do you Bob, take Selma, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, \\'til death do you part? I do. Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you\\'re going? I\\'m the only single girl left in the family. Well, I guess it could be worse. SHUDDUP! Oooh, there\\'s Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny. Dear friends, forty one years ago, God took one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of clay and he made me a woman. And for this, I thank Him. I just wanted to say, on the advice of my new husband, I\\'ve decided to give up smoking. ... Except for after meals and after MacGyver. Why Selma dear, you\\'ll bury us all. Chief Wiggum, you\\'ve been around. You don\\'t trust Sideshow Bob, do you? Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake... I don\\'t know what to say. Just tell me what you know I want to hear. I\\'m dying of jealousy. Thank you. That\\'s right dear, enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you, and the honeymoon is going to be... murder. Welcome to our video honeymoon. We\\'re using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us. Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it. There\\'s Shelbyville Falls... Rolling Rock... And here\\'s another breathtaking sight -- my brand new hubby. I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure! Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That\\'s a good lad. Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, eradicator of deadwood... Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while? And make love? Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace? Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic. Romantic? With Aunt Selma? I guess you\\'re just too young to understand. One of my fillings fell out. Even murder has its ugly side. Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet? Darling, you make it sound like a chore. Hmm, uh, good... Soon I will kill you. Huh? \"Son pied sentis beau\". French, for \"Her foot smells lovely\". Ohhh. Prepare to be murdered. Huh? Be pah de be mudu. That\\'s Sanskrit for your toes are like perfume. Voy a matar a usted. Whaa? That\\'s Spanish for, I\\'m going to kill you. Say what? Why dear, I do believe it\\'s time for your beloved MacGyver. Oh, hey, you\\'re right. Well, time for my walk. Don\\'t forget to die. Ding dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TV with you? Go ahead, Patty. Tonight on MacGyver... Aunt Selma has one hour to live! Hey, down in front. Good bye. Front desk? There\\'s been a terrible accident in my room. Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU. Sideshow Bob, I\\'m afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels. Bart! Selma! Ughhh. You tried to kill me. I want a separation. My best laid plans have gang aglay! Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser? Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before. Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web? Yeah, Bart. Fill us in. Well, I\\'d hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job. No, no, please. It\\'s the only way I\\'ll learn. All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas. Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell. She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette... I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver. Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father. Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she\\'ll be blown to kingdom come! Come again? After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way. To the Simpson mobile! Noooo! But wait! If you saved Selma, why did the room explode? I\\'ll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene. Oh, right, the gas. I\\'ll be back! You can\\'t keep the Democrats out of the White House forever! And when they get in, I\\'m back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies! I feel like such a fool. Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust. Thanks, Mom. Now. Let\\'s get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate. Hey Homer, let\\'s book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act. Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer. Billy Beer! My little guy\\'s first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don\\'t play too loud. Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me. Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don\\'t pick up any of the band\\'s attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything. I hear ya. Come on boy. There goes Davy Crocket in his bald skin cap. In other Spinal Tap news, Mayor Quimby honored the aging super group in a ceremony at City Hall. I guess you could say he was trying to tap into the spines of the young voters, huh? ... Yeah... Let\\'s play the tape. Hey Milhouse, cool jacket! It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe Comics. Now, just meet me back here after the show. Thanks, Dad. Sure you\\'re not gonna be bored? Boy, some of the best times I\\'ve ever had were in the back seat of a car. Oh, Baby! Official \"Tour \\'92\" T-shirts, thirty-one dollars. Uh, yeah, I don\\'t wanna lie to you boys. Six days a week, the place is a hockey rink. Check it out. Spinal Tap kicking Mo-mar Kadaffy in the butt. The timeless classic, now two for a dollar. Hey hey hey, Bill and Marty here. And we\\'re backstage rappin\\' with the Tap. Fellows, I\\'m gonna hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout your career: washed-up. Yet here you are among the top one hundred and five concert acts today. What\\'s your secret guys? Well, after the Berlin Wall fell, our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain, and naturally that gave us a boost. We\\'re very big in Bulgaria, and wassisname, the other garia. Hungaria. Yeah, whoever. I can\\'t think of anyone who\\'s benefited more from the death of Communism than us. Oh, maybe the people who actually live in the Communist countries. Oh yeah, hadn\\'t thought of that. I bet you\\'re right. Yeah, on the other hand, each of us just bought out own soccer team. How many Hungarias can say that, eh? Test... test... Gee, I\\'m sorry, man. Huh? About the frisbee. Frisbee? Say guys, I wonder if you\\'d mind recording a couple of promos for us. Well, like what? Maybe you could say, \"Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL.\" Well, we don\\'t know that, do we? What if somebody rocks as good as you? Or better. I mean, we don\\'t want to look stupid. Okay, we can respect that. How about \"Rock-a-doodle-do, you\\'re listening to Bill and Marty.\" Yeah, sure. That\\'s good... yeah. Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! I just looked out, and there\\'s puddles of water all over the freakin\\' stage! I said slag off! Yeah, well this is a rock concert, not the bleedin\\' ...Splish Splash show! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... SPINAL TAP! WE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO GREW TOO FAST... WE ARE THE DUST OF THE FUTURE PAST... WE RAISE OUR VOICES IN THE NIGHT/ CRYING TO HEAVEN... AND WILL OUR VOICES BE HEARD/ OR WILL THEY BREAK LIKE THE WIND! Medium setting! Thank you! All riiiight! This morning we were driving down... Route 401... That\\'s only four miles from my house! And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville... But nobody rocks like...Springfield! Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump, but that\\'s supposed to be a devil. Filled up with air, it\\'s very evil and impressive. We salute you, our half-inflated Dark Lord. Y\\'know, people think there are only five members of Spinal Tap, but they\\'re wrong. Could we turn up the house lights please? That was the cue to turn up the house lights, so we can tell the audience they\\'re the sixth member of the freakin\\' group. We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it, turn on the lasers. Aagh! My vision! That\\'s it. Show\\'s over. Goodnight, Springton. There will be no encores. They were only on for twenty minutes! What a gyp! Gnarly show, man. Wanna trash the stage? Okay. Cool. Knock it off. THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE\\'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE\\'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG... Tonight a city weeps as, for the first time ever, a hockey arena becomes a scene of violence --following a concert by Spinal Tap. Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby\\'s okay. See for yourself. Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart\\'s \"The Magic Flute\". So what\\'s the answer? Ban all music? In this reporter\\'s opinion the answer, sadly, is yes. Hi, Mom. Oh, oh... thank God! Mom, I want to be a rock star. We\\'ll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay? I\\'ll be right back. Help! Help! Homer, I\\'ve been thinking about what Bart said. If he\\'s really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR. Well, that\\'s a waste of money. We already have a guitar. I meant a real guitar. This is real. Wow! And it came with a free instruction book. Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow! Homer! Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him. I\\'d like to play me latest chart-topper. It\\'s called \"Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs.\" Bart, you\\'ve got to go on. Slag off! You\\'ve changed, man. You used to be about the music. I\\'se just jammin\\' with you. Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play? Polly Wolly Doodle. Oh yeah, well it sounds Polly Wolly Crappy. Haw haw! Burn. Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude. I think it\\'s broken. Oh, really? Give it here. I didn\\'t know you played the guitar, Otto-man! Hey, that\\'s all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time and I\\'d never amount to anything. Now I\\'d like to slow things down a little bit... IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW... WOULD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME? ...CANNOT CHAEAEAEANGE... WAOWAOWAOWAOW... Although I\\'m sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my bus mates, I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago. Whoooa! Uh oh. Better fasten your seatbelts, little dudes. We don\\'t have seatbelts. Huh... well then, just try to go limp. Better take a shortcut. Good show last night. Yeah, quite good. Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number? Oh, it\\'s a miracle no one was hurt. I stand on my record. Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality. Let\\'s see your license, pal. No can do. Never got one. But if you need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear. Oh, wait, these aren\\'t mine. Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay. Who\\'s gonna drive the bus? I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it. Where\\'s Otto? Otto. That\\'s one palindrome you won\\'t be hearing for awhile. Off we go! HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER / HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN. HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! HA HA! Dum de dum... There\\'s an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That\\'d be cutting it a little close. I think you have to be more aggressive, sir. Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in. What\\'s so funny? I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the toaster. We\\'ll watch the tape tonight. Oh look, you\\'ve got someone at your window. Dododo do do do. My name\\'s Patty. I\\'ll be testing you. When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions? Yeah, one. Have you always been a chick? I mean, I don\\'t want to offend you but you were born a man, weren\\'t you? You can tell me, I\\'m open-minded. I won\\'t be needing this. All right! Yeah!... So, how\\'d I do? Well, you failed every segment and misspelled \"bus\" on your application. Drag. Let me in! Let me in! HE STEPS ON THE CLUTCH, AND THE TOILET GOES FLUSH / HAIL TO THE-- Hey Landlord, some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door and put up an eviction notice. Yeah, that was me. You! But... but why? Because you haven\\'t paid your rent. Well, can I at least get my stuff? All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old cycle magazines. Wow, I had mustard? Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don\\'t spare the syrup. Perhaps you\\'d like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee. Uh... okay. You can really taste the chutney. Uggh... Ow! Otto-man? You\\'re living in a dumpster? Oh, man, I wish. \"Dumpster\" brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a \"Trash-Co\" waste disposal unit. Otto, why don\\'t you come home with me? You can stay in our garage. A garage?! Oh, somebody up there likes me. I FEEL LIKE ROCKIN\\' SO I THINK I WILL / I\\'LL ROCK IT, ROCK IT, ROCK IT \\'TIL I GET MY FILL... YEAH! Ooh! Hey. Bart, what\\'s going on? Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it. What conversation? Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can! Marge, what were you thinking? That\\'s not my voice! Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape. I don\\'t understand this. Why can\\'t you stay with your parents? The admiral and I don\\'t get along. Please let me stay here. I\\'ve got nowhere else to go. Forget it. That line didn\\'t work for my dad and it\\'s not gonna work for you. Dad, Otto\\'s going through a real tough time. Can\\'t he stay with us for awhile? I know we didn\\'t ask for this, Homer, but doesn\\'t the Bible say, \"Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?\" Yes, but doesn\\'t the Bible also say, \"Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut\"? Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he\\'ll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can. All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage. Wow, what\\'s the catch? A can of corn costs... fifty-seven cents! I could sure go for a can of corn. Otto, you can\\'t just sit there watching TV all day. You know, you\\'re right. I should do a little reading. You got any of those \"Where\\'s Waldo\" books? No. How about anything written from the Vampire\\'s point of view? No. Well, how \\'bout anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks? Otto, I think you should get a job. Look, the only thing I was ever good at was driving a bus and now \"the man\" says I need a piece of paper to do that. So get that piece of paper! I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try. Will you knock it off! I can\\'t hear myself think. That\\'s better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore? I\\'ll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn\\'t good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you\\'re not mad. You can do it, Otto. You\\'re the coolest adult I ever met. Uh-huh. Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I\\'m not mad. If something\\'s hard to do, then it\\'s not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we\\'ll go inside and watch TV. What\\'s on? It doesn\\'t matter. Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling. Hey, Pop \\'N\\'Fresh. You\\'re supposed to giggle. That guy has gotta go. I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids. ... So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind. So finally she swerves off the road into the woods and lost the other car. And that\\'s when she realized the man in the other car wasn\\'t trying to hurt her. No, he was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat! Did the maniac kill her? Natch! And you know how I know? How? Because... I was that maniac! Hey, hey, I was just kidding. That\\'s it. He\\'s outta here. But Homer, we\\'re the only family he\\'s got... I don\\'t care. This is not \"Happy Days\" and he is not the Fonz. Heyyy, Mr. S... Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house! Heavy. What are you going to do, Otto? Oh, don\\'t worry. There\\'s plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death. Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again. Wow! I\\'ve never been called an adult before. I\\'ve been tried as one but... I\\'ll do it! \"Alcohol increases your ability to drive.\" False? Oh, man. I don\\'t know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum. He didn\\'t call you a bum, he called you a sponge. Sponge?! Does this look like something a sponge would do I\\'ll show him who\\'s a sponge. Well, if it isn\\'t Wee Willy Washout. I want to take the test again. Why? So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson\\'s big bald head. Really? Well, here\\'s your written test. I\\'ll get you started. B, C, D, A, B. Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days. It wasn\\'t little either. It was a chicken wing. Wing. What was that? It doesn\\'t matter. Let\\'s get some Margaritas. I\\'m buyin\\'! Otto! That\\'s what my driver\\'s license says. HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER... Yes, hail to the bus driver... Bus Driver Man! Why you little... What the... Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted. Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball. Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future. Will I pass my English test? Outlook not so good. Wow! It does work! Let me try. Will I get beat up today? \"All signs point to yes.\" That ball knows everything. Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we\\'re toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) \"Don\\'t count on it.\" Will Milhouse and I be friends when we\\'re high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? \"It looks doubtful.\" Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day? What could come between two bestest buddies like us? Samantha I\\'ve always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do. I\\'m a good student, Principal Skinner. Yeah sure, and they told me I\\'d get a big parade when I got back from \\'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let\\'s just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we? Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade. That\\'s in there? Don\\'t worry. They\\'ll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I\\'d wake up screaming. Well, let\\'s meet your classmates. Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test? To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say \"Behold my \"F!\" Attention class, I have a new student for you. Great, another student. Just keep packing \\'em in, Seymour. I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it\\'s never easy to come to a new school, so let\\'s make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky. Stanky. Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, goodbye. I\\'m sure this is a little scary for you, dear. Uh-huh. So why don\\'t you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I\\'ll be grading you on grammar and poise. We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you\\'re all probably used to -- but I\\'m not. It\\'ll take you about six weeks, dear. Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie? Sure. Eew! Victim number four. Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie? Sure! When I find out who hit me with that ball... I\\'m gonna tear \\'em a new... Wuh. Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film. Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents\\' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls. Bo-ring! Eew! She\\'s faking it. Any questions? Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don\\'t live with Mr. Krabappel? Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole. How do we know when we fall in love? Oh, don\\'t you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone. How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature? I\\'m sorry, that would be playing God. God shmod, I want my monkey-man. Ah, that\\'s a nice dress. My dad makes me wear it. I hate it. Well, I hate it too. Uh -- can I walk you home? Okay. Everybody on, but no shoving. Just kiddin\\', you can shove all you want. Hey, wait Otto-man, you can\\'t leave. Milhouse isn\\'t here yet. Sorry Bart-dude, no time. My girlfriend\\'s dancing topless at the airport bar from four fifteen to four twenty. Hey, Bart. Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise. Hi. Hey, what\\'s with the skirt? I\\'ve brought friends to this treehouse before. Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude? Maybe I should go. So long stomach. We\\'ve had a lot of great memories. No, that\\'s okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. Let\\'s see, something for the lady...ah, \"Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag. Got any girl comics? Like \"Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney,\" \"Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins,\" or \"L\\'il Kneesocks?\" No, but my sister\\'s got a wide selection of crappy comics. you guys wanna see something gross? Tonight on Smartline -- \"I\\'m Okay, You\\'re Too Fat\". Here\\'s your host, Kent Brockman. Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon. This sucks. Where is that channel changer? Oh, eh, I\\'ll give it a chance. Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes. I wish they had never invented fried cheese! We\\'ve got to widen the hole. Well, make it snappy. The chain\\'s startin\\' to give! We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the \"Good Morning Burger!\" I gotta help him. Okay, Milhouse... I\\'ll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel. Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch. Milhouse, I gotta go. My dad thinks I\\'m having my braces examined. Well, you kinda-sorta are. Milhouse, we\\'re living in the age of cooties. I can\\'t believe the risk you\\'re running. Besides, what\\'s so great about kissing? Bart, it\\'s not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin\\' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt? But she doesn\\'t melt. Oh yes she does! We start with pure milk chocolate... Chocolate... Add a layer of farm-fresh honey... Ooh, sweet. Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar... And dip it in rich creamery butter. Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger? I\\'d say \"You\\'re a lying scumbag.\" Why sweetie? According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That\\'s where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it. Oh Lisa, that\\'s a load of rich, creamery butter. They\\'ll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less. Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge? Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are. Lisa, what\\'s that number? Operator, I\\'d like to place an order for my husband. Would he like to lose weight, stop smoking, learn the state capitals, master hostage negotiations... Hmmm... Hostage negotiations. Listen, Tabouli, we\\'re ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that? Better give me the weight loss tape. We\\'re out of \"Subliminally Slim.\" Eh, just send him the vocabulary builder. Here you go, fatso. Hello, this is Doctor Marvin Monroe \"Let\\'s build your vocabulary\" A: abattoir: slaughterhouse. \"The cow was slaughtered in the abattoir.\" Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite? Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety. Don\\'t you usually play with Milhouse after school? He has a girlfriend. Milhouse? Yeah, all they do is kiss. No. How cute. Hey Martin. Bart? This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes. Listen Martin, right now I\\'m looking for a friend who won\\'t leave me for a girl. That\\'s me. I\\'m just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps. Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school? It\\'s a date. Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we are friends! Now Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute? Uh, sure. \"COME HOME MY BONNIE WARRIOR, / FOR NOW THE NETS ARE FULL OF FISH --\" I don\\'t know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight. Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve. There\\'s another thing I\\'ve been wanting to talk to you about... Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary! What in God\\'s name are you talking about? Oh. Hey, guys. Wow, that really took my mind off those awful transforming space mutants. Good. Man, I could sure go for a snack. Me too. Hey, I\\'ve got an idea. Why don\\'t the three of us go spit on the Principal\\'s car? Listen, Bart... there\\'s such a thing as spendin\\' too much time together. Oh. Fine. I\\'m tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There\\'s plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town. Bart, wait! Yeah? Uh... can we still use your tree house? What? Get bent. If her father catches us -- he\\'ll kill her. All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house. Thanks, Bart. Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy! Now there\\'s a Machiavellian countenance. Ooh...a sextet of ale. Hello, Mr. Stanky... I have some shocking news about your daughter Samantha... Who am I? Let\\'s just say I\\'m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands. I bet you had peanut butter for breakfast. Yeah... Samantha! Dad! Nooooooooooo! Samantha, you\\'re my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just, just tell me what happened. Well, Milhouse and I -- That\\'s enough! I\\'m putting you in an all girls school. You\\'re never going to see that boy again. Milhouse! Samantha! Well Milhouse, \"\\'Tis better to have loved and lost\"... yada yada yada... let\\'s go to the arcade. Nah. How could this happen? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Haruspicy: Predicting the future through the study of animal entrails. Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is? The vernal equinox? No. It\\'s two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. Let\\'s get you on the scale. You\\'ve gained thirteen pounds. Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them! There stands a broken man. It\\'s recess everywhere but in his heart. Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger. Five fingers? Ew, freak show. Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom\\'s not here. Why didn\\'t you go to dad? I did, but I couldn\\'t understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn\\'t even know I did it. Well, according to \"Eternity\" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won\\'t be on the market for another six months. So I guess you\\'re gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse. Bart, I\\'m glad you\\'re here. Milhouse could use a friend like you. Yeah. Milhouse? Bart, I didn\\'t want you to see me cry. Oh, come on, I\\'ve seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they\\'re out of chocolate milk. You cry when you\\'re doing long division and you have a remainder left over. Well, I didn\\'t want you to see me cry this time. Listen, Milhouse. I\\'ve got a confession to make. I\\'m the one who narked on your kissing. What?! Milhouse is out of bed and full of beans. Whoa, it\\'s a miracle! Boy, I bet the 8-ball didn\\'t see that one comin\\'. Yeah. Marge, where\\'s that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food. You mean a spoon? Yuh. Yuh. Yuh. Yeah that\\'s good. Are you sure you want to do this? I can\\'t stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces. How are we going to find her? She said she\\'d be wearing a plaid jumper. Milhouse! Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears. Hey Samantha, I\\'m sorry about gettin\\' you thrown in the penguin house. That\\'s all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian\\'s. It\\'s run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They\\'re very nice, except they never let me out. Dominique - nique - nique, etc. Samantha, ne pas de boys! I have to go now, Milhouse. I\\'d better not. It\\'s fifty rosaries a kiss. Oh, okay. Oh, what the heck. Bart, think I can ever find another one like her? You\\'re asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let\\'s go whip donuts at old people Forgot there was a physical today, huh? Yeah. Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear? This can\\'t be right. This man has 104% body fat! Hey, no eating in the tank! Go to hell. How was your day at work, dear? Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough... Sir, I\\'m afraid Homer Simpson is sterile. Who? One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical. Ewww. Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample. Hm. Oh yes. I\\'m afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he\\'s shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions. Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers! Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you\\'re all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I\\'m rambling. Anybody want any coffee? I\\'ll have some coffee. Want it black, don\\'t you? Black like your heart! It\\'s so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I\\'m sorry. It\\'s my problem. I\\'ll deal with it. Please continue. If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he\\'ll be so dazzled, he\\'ll sign anything you shove under his nose. Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot. Do you have any cream? Oh yes, of course. Where are my manners? Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned \"Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors\". Then those Disney sleezeballs shut me down. I said, \"Look, I\\'ll change the logo, put Mickey\\'s pants back on\". Some guys you just can\\'t reason with. Well, I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was givin\\' them Japanese names. You guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback? Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long lost half- brother. Homer! Herb? I let him design a car that would make or break my company. Presenting... The Homer! I\\'m ruined! Forbes Magazine called it the \"Blunder of the Century.\" A little overblown, don\\'t you think? What about new Coke? Hey, I invented that. Yeah, but all that\\'s in the past. Because this is America and in America you\\'re never finished as long as you\\'ve got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea. Well, I\\'m lit. Me too. And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics. What the hell are you two... Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this? We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise. We leapt off just in time to see it collapse. There, there. You\\'re safe now, little sister. Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV\\'s brightest stars come out to shine!? Oh, goodbye, old girl. We\\'ve had a lot of great memories. \"That\\'s right, I shot J.R.\" \"Except for huge gaps in the Western states, Hands Across America was a complete success.\" Hands across America... \"Well, I never thought I\\'d see it. They\\'re dancing on the Berlin Wall. These lithe and lively lovers of liberation...\" Boring. Sorry I ruined your date Sergeant Carter. Pyle! Well friend, you\\'re going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders\\' house. Let\\'s see, I need an idea... idea... idea... What\\'s the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas. What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home? Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you? Please don\\'t hurt me. Consider it done. Hey pal, I heard about the couch. Yeah, you gonna to be okay? Yeah. You know, my life just can\\'t get any worse. That\\'s right. There\\'s no way my life could possibly get any worse. Simpson! Report to Mr. Burns\\' office at once! Is this the one with the lazy sperm? Hmmm hmmm. Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars? Would I! All you have to do is sign this form. Wait a minute. I\\'m not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it. All right, well, it just explains that you\\'ve won -- yes, that\\'s it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence! Don\\'t I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony? IT\\'S THE FIRST ANNUAL MONTGOMERY BURNS/ AWARD FOR --,its the first annual montgomery burns award for --,9 OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN - THE FIELD OF -- EXCELLENCE!\" Herb! Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society. This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw. What about the Emmys? I stand corrected. And now to present the award, here\\'s former heavyweight champion, Smokin\\' Joe Frazier. Webster\\'s Dictionary defines excellence as \"the quality or condition of being excellent\". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence. Please please please please please... Dad, you know you won. Don\\'t jinx it! The winner... Homer Simpson! Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win! Keep those pickled eggs comin\\', Moe. You cleaned me out Smokin\\' Joe. What\\'s the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight? I miss my couch. I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship. Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There\\'s like three of those. That couch was one of a kind. Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you\\'ll be walking along and you\\'ll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much. Hey, Frazier, shut up! Barney, you\\'ve been riding my back all night. Oh yeah? Care to step outside? Let\\'s do it. I think I\\'m gonna take a walk. All right! A peanut! I\\'m telling you, all a man needs is an idea. And I\\'ve got an idea. Then how come you\\'re still a bum? All right. A man needs two things, an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what\\'s this? \"Local man, Homer Simpson, receives award and $2,000 check.\" Hmmm... Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield? Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That\\'s the one. I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless. Wow. The Spine Melter 2000. Give me full power. But sir... Dammit, I said full power! Dad? Dad? I\\'ll take it. This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that. Marge, there\\'s an empty spot I\\'ve always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer. This money was a blessing. We can\\'t just spend it on some creature comfort. All right, we won\\'t get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky. Yes? Oh... uh... sorry, I must have the wrong house. Ho, ho, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong, friend. Aren\\'t we in luck? Today\\'s our tithe day and we\\'ve got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you. Hey wait a minute... Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet? I think it\\'s Mom\\'s turn, son. Ah, no fair. Thanks for the suit. Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables. ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS... \"MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC...\" They\\'re singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf. What am I gonna say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he\\'s family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them... Unky Herb! Bart... Lisa. I\\'m so glad to see you. You weren\\'t so glad to see me. I\\'m sorry, Homer. But I\\'m still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face. Well, while you\\'re a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt? I\\'ll try, but I\\'m not making any promises. Herb! How have you been? I\\'ve been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin\\' out of dumpsters. You? Can\\'t complain. Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode. On... off... on... off. Homer, he knows how to work a light switch. Oh, yeah. Right. I don\\'t know what this switch does. This is really great, Marge. I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel. They do good work. Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself? Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese. Lisa, aren\\'t you happy to see me? Why didn\\'t you write, Unky Herb? Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? \"Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop. I see your point. WHETHER YOU\\'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR! Maggie, I\\'m gonna let you in on a little secret. You\\'re gonna make me rich again. Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are! One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue. And while on Ventnor Avenue you\\'ll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill. Get to the point. Eleven hundred and fifty bones. That\\'s all I got. Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you\\'re just not much of a businessman. Maybe we should play another game. Why are we playin\\' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence? Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from \"New Republic for Kids.\" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: \"Paradise Regained,\" \"Martin Chuzzlewit,\" or Herman Melville\\'s twin classics \"Omoo\" and \"Typee\". Wait, Marge. Didn\\'t you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair? That was your idea. I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year! Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer. How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance? Nah. Homer, wait. Herb, what\\'re you talking about? Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world. Twenty minutes?! Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I\\'d like to show you this. It\\'s drinking the water! Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed... This is the greatest invention in the world! You\\'ll make a million dollars! No, Homer. That invention is out already. I\\'m just using it as an example. It\\'s going back for more! Homer, this is my invention. Now, of course, with these blueprints you\\'ll have to use your imagination. Maggie! Maggie! It\\'s a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby\\'s cries. Then it tells whoever\\'s around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from \"Change me\" to \"turn off that damn Raffi record.\" That\\'s a very clever idea! All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You\\'ll have your money back in thirty days. I swear. I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him. Dad, you know some shyster\\'s gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother. All right, Herb, I\\'ll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother. Nope. Okay, then just give me the drinking bird. Now, let\\'s see... What could you be trying to say? Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap... I want to suck your nose. Ooga booga! Ooga booga! I\\'m scared. Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for \"Burp Me\", and this saw-tooth formation is something I\\'ve never... Eureka. Now, I bet you\\'re all wondering what lies under this sheet. Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john. Oh. Well, here it is again. My \"Baby Translator!\" Whoooa!! Marge, you don\\'t have to humor me. Well, it\\'s pretty ingrained. What do you think, Homer? Herb, this is the stupidest thing I\\'ve ever seen. I can\\'t believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks. Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass! I try, but I can\\'t. Lavish attention on me and entertain me. Maggie, you talked! You see! It tells you exactly what\\'s on the baby\\'s mind. Never mind. Where did you go? Peek-a-boo! Oh, there you are. Very amusing. Well, Homer, now what do you think? I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something. Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these. I have soiled myself. How embarrassing. I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear. Don\\'t worry, he can\\'t stay mad at you forever. He is your brother. Well, when is he gonna act like it? This radio controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly, just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-loop... then bring it in for the perfect landing. Whoop, oh dear. My wife is going to kill me. I only want to eat candy! Then that\\'s all you\\'ll get. This leash demeans us both. I\\'ll take two. I\\'ll take a dozen! I represent the \"Precious Baby Discount Stores\". I\\'ll take 50,000. I\\'m rich again! USA! USA! USA! Homer, here\\'s a check for two-thousand dollars. But I also wanted to give you each a little something for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume of The Great Books of Western Civilization. You\\'ll receive a new one every month. From \"Beowulf\" to \"Less Than Zero.\" Finally, a copy of \"Ethan Frome\" to call my own. Now Bart, I know you\\'re too young for the machine gun you wanted. But I\\'m gonna give you something that\\'ll make sure when you\\'re old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association. Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too? It\\'s in the Constitution, son. Maggie, who brought me my fortune I\\'ll give you anything you want in this world. I want what the dog\\'s eating. I\\'ll get you somethin\\' nice. Now Marge... Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don\\'t need any gift from you. You\\'re too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer. And I sold the old ones for fifty bucks. Come on washer! Oh, you stupid dryer! Herb, I don\\'t think there\\'s a vibrating chair in that bag for me. Homer, walk me to my car. What do I get? What do I get? It\\'s not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don\\'t want it. This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same. That\\'s it? That\\'s it. I see your point, brother. Gimme a hug, brother. All right... but I never really hugged a man before. Homer, I bought you the damn chair. That\\'s enough already. Get outta here! Well, children, it\\'s the last day of school. Here are your grades. Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I don\\'t get a C average, my Dad won\\'t let me go to Kamp Krusty. Well, it isn\\'t fair to the other children, but, all right. Much obliged, doll. Oh Bart Simpson, I\\'m gonna miss you. Attention, everyone. This is Principal Skinner. I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction. Now let\\'s trash this dump! Somebody put a torch to these permanent records! Quickly now. La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la. La-la-... Wake up, boy. Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school. Well it is. Oh how do I know this isn\\'t some beautiful dream, too? You know, a pinch is more traditional. Homie, you do remember your promise to the children? Sure do. When you\\'re eighteen, you\\'re out the door. No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, you\\'re looking at one happy camper. Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C. Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you\\'d better keep your end of it. I don\\'t think I\\'d be any kind of a father if you got D\\'s and I let you go to Kamp Krusty. But Dad... Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they\\'re about to announce the lottery numbers. 17... 32... 5... 8... Woo-hoo! 47... Attention students: please clear out your lockers into the waste baskets provided. 36-24-36... Now let\\'s see what we got here. Ah, my gym shorts. Bart, where\\'s your bathing suit? I\\'m gonna swim nekkid. Here are your final report cards. I have nothing left to say to any of you, so if nobody minds, let\\'s just quietly run out the clock. ARITHMETIC: A SOCIAL STUDIES: A CONDUCT: B+ ENGLISH: A ART: A P.E.: A I\\'ve never gotten a B before. How could this have happened? I feel so dirty. Uh.. uh...uh. The dirt\\'s not coming off. Okay. Calm down. This must just be a little typo. Oh Miss Hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. You gave me a B+ in conduct. Now Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record. Perhaps I\\'m not making myself clear. I think you should reconsider. Lisa... you\\'re... hurting me. Mrs. Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, I hope you\\'ll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition. In some cases, still in their original wrappings. Duly noted. I\\'d also like to add as I gaze upon your beauty, I\\'ve never seen an angel fly so low. Forget it, short pants. Mrs. Krabappel, if I don\\'t get at least a C average I can\\'t go to Kamp Krusty. Have a \"D\"-lightful summer. Five! Four! Three! Two! Don\\'t open your mouth. One! Wait a minute! You didn\\'t learn how World War Two ended! We won! You\\'re what? Hmmm, I haven\\'t seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon. Well, William, another school year gone by. And may I say a job well done, sir. Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back. Aye, sir. Ya silk-wearing buttercup... All right! Three whole months of Spaghetti-O\\'s and daytime TV! So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty? You bet. Check out this hand. All aces! A+! Oh, Bart, why didn\\'t you at least forge plausible grades? Hi kids! Only one week left to sign up for the bestest summer ever at Kamp Krusty! Kamp Krusty is built on an actual Indian burial ground. We\\'ve got archery, wallet-making, the whole megillah. And for you fat kids, my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will really get results. And the best part is when you come to Kamp Krusty, you\\'ll spend the summer with me. Honest Injun! Well, here goes nothin\\'. Stupid roller-skate. Well, dad, here\\'s my report card. I think you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised. A+? You don\\'t think much of me, do you boy? No, sir. You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy. So I won\\'t get to go to camp? Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn\\'t. But why should you pay for my mistake? You mean I can go? Yeah. I didn\\'t want you hangin\\' around all summer anyway. Oh, Dad. You\\'re the best father a boy could ever have! Thanks son. Now, you\\'ve got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate? Ah sure, there\\'ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won\\'t dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty. Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier? Before I go to camp, I\\'ll need boosters for malaria, German Measles, encephalitis, Hansen\\'s disease... Oh now, I\\'m afraid what we have here is an advanced case of hypochondria. There\\'s only one known cure. A wowwy-pop. Don\\'t patronize me, doctor. It\\'s our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn\\'t cry. Oh, I\\'m going to miss this. Hey, hands off my pickle. I don\\'t see your name on it, boy. No, but... Oh yeah? Check... mate. Always thinking two moves ahead. We\\'ll see you when you get back from Image Enhancement camp. Spare me your euphemisms. It\\'s Fat Camp for Daddy\\'s chubby little secret. You promised you wouldn\\'t make a scene. Good-bye my special little guy. Lisa, watch out for poison ivy. Remember, \"Leaves of 3, let it be. \"Leaves of 4, eat some more.\" I\\'ll write you every day. Don\\'t look in my closet. In fact, stay out of my room all together. If the pets die, don\\'t replace them. I\\'ll know! Hi kids! Welcome to Kamp Krusty! I\\'ll see you in a few weeks. Until then, I\\'ve turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world -- Mr. Black. I want you to treat Mr. Black with the same respect you would give me. Now, here\\'s Mr. Black. Louder! Faster! He\\'s still funny, but not ha-ha funny. Thank you Krusty, and welcome children. I am Mr. Black, your head counselor. For the past fifteen years, I was President of Euro Krustyland... until it blew up. I\\'ll take any questions you might have. You... and then uh, one more. Can we call you Uncle Blackie? No. Last question. When do we get to see Krusty? Ah, he will be along eventually. In the meantime, our counselors Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney will be happy to handle any problems you may have. Looks like we got ourselves a troublemaker. You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I\\'m finished. Oh no you\\'re not. Ohhh... He-he-he. Whoa!! Here\\'s your cabin. You don\\'t like it, T.F. This is a little more rustic than I expected. I\\'m not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this... The Krusty Brand seal of approval. You can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of Krusty the Clown. Aaaahhhh! Whoops, I should have warned you. That clock gets incredibly hot if you leave it plugged in. That\\'s okay. Eh, all this stuff is fine. Now I\\'m off to Wimbledon! Don\\'t we get to roast marshmallows? Shut up and eat your pine cone. Are you sure that\\'s safe? Well, it ain\\'t getting any safer! All right, you balls of pan drippings, I want to see Crisco coming out of those pores. We\\'re not leaving until this Christmas ham gives me a pull-up. HAIL TO THEE KAMP KRUS-TY / BY THE SHORES OF BIG SNAKE LAKE / THOUGH YOUR SWINGS ARE RUS-TY / WE KNOW THEY\\'LL NEVER BREAK... FROM YOUR GLEAMING MESS-HALL / TO YOUR HOLLOW BASEBALL FIELD / YOUR SPIC AND SPAN INFIRMARY / WHERE ALL OUR WOUNDS ARE HEALED... / HAIL TO THEE CAMP KRUSTY / BELOW MT. AVALANCHE... WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE KAMP KRUSTY / A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF THE KRUSTY CORPORATION... You\\'re serving us gruel? Not quite. This is \"Krusty Brand Imitation Gruel.\" nine out of ten orphans can\\'t tell the difference. Yo, Mr. Black, another brandy. To evil. Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds! Oh, that\\'s wonderful. And look. New hair! I\\'m this close to having a comb-over! Lights out, losers. Yeah, we\\'re meetin\\' some tail on the other side of the lake. I feel like I\\'m gonna die, Bart. We\\'re all gonna die, Lis. I meant soon. So did I. Mmmm... strawberries. Ah, That\\'s good. Hey, Lendl! Choke! Choke! Yeah! Point and game - Becker. And will the harlequin in the third row please keep his voice down. Sorry folks. Sorry, Your Majesty. Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he\\'s been since...well, ever. Size... right... agility! We miss you terribly. I hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home. Hey Simpson, tell your mom her cookies sucked. Dear Mom and Dad, I no longer fear Hell, because I\\'ve been to Kamp Krusty. Our nature hikes have become grim death marches. A snake bit me. Back in line, maggot. Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse. Come on, wimps, these Gucci wallets have to be on the streets of Hong Kong by Friday. Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the clown will come through. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. But I am far more pessimistic. I am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut. Giddyap. And now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. So I close by saying, save us! Save us now! Bart and Lisa. Ah, kids\\' letters from camp. She complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won\\'t want to leave. Lisa, I\\'ve been thinking it over, and next summer I am getting a job. Oh... Homer, it\\'s getting late, we\\'ll miss the fireworks. Marge, we\\'ve got all the fireworks we need right here. Well kids, uh, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner and here it is. The man who took an abandoned mule tannery and turned it into a summer wonderland, Mr. Krusty the Clown. See, I told you Krusty would come. Just like I said, heh, heh. He\\'s gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies. Now I must tell you kids, Krusty has laryngitis and a bad back so he won\\'t be saying anything or doing anything. Krusty looks fat. He\\'s really having trouble keeping his balance. Tijuana! That\\'s not Krusty the Clown. What do you think, I slapped a clown suit on some wino? Yeah, Bart, I am so Krunchy the Klown . We want Krusty! We want Krusty! Yeah, we want Krunchy! We want Krunchy! I thought you said you broke their spirits. We did. You broke nothing! Let\\'s get \\'em! To the hydrofoil. My chunky brothers, gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom! Ahh, sweet nourishing gruel! Kowalski! My brownies! Wiggum! A change of underwear! Crandall! My insulin! Bart, you said you were gonna name it \"Camp Freedom.\" Ehh, this has more zing. I dub thee, Sir... There\\'s a call for Mr. Clown. This\\'d better be important. Oy gavolt! Just let your head flop back and forth. Your neck is a well-cooked piece of asparagas. We interrupt \"Sadruddin Mabaradad\\'s Yoga Party\" for this special bulletin. KRISIS AT KAMP KRUSTY. Get ready for two weeks at the happiest place on earth: Ladies and gentlemen, I\\'ve been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together. Burn, Krusty, burn. Burn, Krusty, burn. A group of school-age Spartacuses has taken this camp by force. Three counselors are missing and presumed scared. What\\'s that? I\\'m being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ring leader. Don\\'t be the boy. Don\\'t be the boy. I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say \"crappy\" on TV? Yes, on this network you can. Are you and Princess Di just friends? You people make me sick. You\\'re vultures. Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way you parasites. I said out of my way. I\\'m no fake, I am the real Krusty. Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, \"President Clown\"? I don\\'t know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year. I smell bacon. Let\\'s see if he\\'s wearing a wire. It is the real Krusty. Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple. Well, at least you\\'re not as bad as customs. How could you, Krusty? I\\'d never lend my name to an inferior product. They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house. I\\'m not made of stone! Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear. Oh my God. Well actually, the bear just ate his hat. Was it a nice hat? Oh yeah. Oh my God. Well, I\\'m gonna make it all up to you. I\\'m gonna show you kids the time of your lives. Live, from beautiful Laughlin, Nevada: It\\'s the Miss American Girl Pageant! Brought to you by Meryl Streep\\'s \"Versatility\". Smell like Streep... For Cheap! I\\'m your host, Troy McClure. And now... here come the ladies! WE LEARNED THE TRUTH AT SEVENTEEN / THAT LOVE WAS MEANT FOR BEAUTY QUEENS... Like Miss South Dakota!... Miss North Carolina!... Miss Indiana!... Alaska!... Kids, I won\\'t be home tonight, So I\\'m leaving you some low-cal microwavable TV dinners. Yuh huh. Doh-kay. I\\'m auditioning for a play! It\\'s a musical version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Isn\\'t that exciting? If you ask me they\\'re all winners! We\\'ll be cutting our first forty contestants right after this. Let\\'s take a minute to meet our distinguished panel of judges. Skin care consultant, Rowena... Syndicated columnist, William F. George... Token Black Panelist, Drederick Tatum... and Mr. Bozwell, the man behind those infamous \"Worst-Dressed Lists\". Mr. Bozwell, can you give us a sneak peek at this year\\'s list? Memo to Goldie Hawn: Cheerleading tryouts were thirty years ago. Let\\'s grow up, shall we? He\\'s such a bitch. I haven\\'t been in a play since high school, and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults. Sounds interesting. You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie... and sometimes it\\'s like I don\\'t even exist. Sounds interesting. It\\'s time to name our five finalists, starting with... Miss Montana! A beaut from Butte. Miss South Carolina! Nothin\\' could be finah. Miss Delaware! She, uh... Good for her. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Marge keep it down in there. Homer, my audition is in half... Hey look, it\\'s last year\\'s winner, Deborah Jo Smallwood! Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end. And I\\'d like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations. Maggie! Cut that racket! And where exactly are you going? I\\'m auditioning for a play. Well, this is the first I\\'ve heard about it. I told you several times. It\\'s a musical version of \"A Streetcar Named...\" Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I\\'m not an idiot! Well... I thought I told you.. Kids, back me up. He\\'s right, mom. Sorry. Match point, Homer. I\\'m sorry, Honey. That\\'s okay. We\\'re none of us perfect. Well, howdy-do neighbor. Hi, Ned. I didn\\'t know you were an actor. Oh, indeedily-doodily. I\\'ve even been in \"Streetcar\" once before. I played Blanche DuBois! Hmmm huh. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school. Hello, I am Llewellyn Sinclair! I have directed three plays in my career, and I have had three heart attacks. That\\'s how much I care. I\\'m planning for a fourth. Maybe I should have taken a nice calligraphy class. Ah, forget about it. That Mr. Takahashi\\'s a lunatic. Quiet! All right. I am not an easy man to work for. While directing \"Hats Off to Hanukkah,\" I reduced more than one cast member to tears. Did I expect too much from fourth graders? The review \"Play Enjoyed By All\" -- speaks for itself. Those auditioning for the role of Stanley... Take off your shirts. Take off your shirts! Deshabillez votre chemises! Schnell! Schnell! Schnell! Uh huh... nope... try joining a gym... Oh ye Gods! Hey man, if you like that, you should see my butt. You. You\\'re my Stanley. Hot diggity! How \\'bout that, Marge? Li\\'l ol\\' Stanley me! \"Stella!\" \"Stella!\" Heh heh. Hey look me over... Next. Won\\'t you come home Bill Bailey... Next. There\\'s got to be a morning after... Next. Love... Thank you for nothing. You\\'re all terrible. What you ladies don\\'t understand is that Blanche is a delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout. Forget it! Just strike the sets! Clear the stage! This production is... Homie, I didn\\'t get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid. Wait a minute. I\\'ll come home right away. All right, I\\'ll pick up a bucket of fried chicken... extra skin, rolls, chocolate cream parfait... Stop bothering my Blanche! I play an aging southern beauty who\\'s driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law Stanley. Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill. Are there any jive-talking robots in this play? I don\\'t think so. Bart, don\\'t ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity? No, Homer. My name is Helen Lovejoy, and I\\'ll be playing Stella. I am Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. I play Steve. My name is Ot-to, and I\\'m playing Pab-lo. Lionel Hutz, Attorney at Law. I\\'m filing a class action suit against the director on behalf of everyone who was cut from the play. I also play Mitch! I\\'m Marge Simpson, I\\'ll be playing Blanche. I made some peanut butter brownies for everyone. Well, would anyone else like a bite of banality? I would. Stanley, you\\'re, you\\'re pulsing with animal lust. You take Blanche and fling her roughly to the bed. Roger-dodger. Aww... isn\\'t that cute? And me without a camera. Here. My sister runs a day care center. Well, I guess a few weeks wouldn\\'t hurt her. Maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime... A bottle? Mrs. Simpson, do you know what a baby is saying when she reaches for a bottle? Ba-ba? She\\'s saying, \"I am a leech.\" Our aim here is to develop the \"bottle within.\" That sounds awfully harsh. Mrs. Simpson, I don\\'t like to toot my own horn, but we\\'re the only day center in town that\\'s not currently under investigation by the state. Oh, well. Be a good girl, Maggie. I\\'m sorry Maggie, we don\\'t allow these here. You\\'re a dame and I\\'m a fella. Stanley, stop or I\\'ll tell Stella. Passion, Mrs. Simpson, anger! This man disgusts you! All I want is one embrace. I\\'ll twist this bottle in your face... Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these... there, there\\'s the ol\\' face-shredder! Mrs. Simpson, if you set out to push the bile to the tip of my throat... mission accomplished. I\\'m, I\\'m going to crawl into bed with a bottle of Amaretto. Good day. Is that true? Homer, can you run some lines with me? Make Bart do it. It\\'ll just take a sec. Gutterball. You see, Marge, while you\\'re off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too. Don\\'t like to nap, eh? We have a place for babies like you... the box! All right, let ham-ateur night in Dixie commence. I\\'m sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don\\'t see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley\\'s face. Couldn\\'t she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor? Marge, your ride\\'s here. Homer, it\\'ll just be a few minutes more! You\\'re a dame and I\\'m a fella. Stanley stop, or I\\'ll tell Stella. Marge! Marge! I\\'m asking for white hot rage and you\\'re giving me a hissy fit! Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine? Oh here! Hey, there\\'s quarters in here! I just don\\'t see what\\'s so bad about Stanley. Stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud. Marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. You can\\'t let that happen. Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I\\'ll be out in the car. All I want is one embrace. Marge, move it or lose it! I\\'ll twist this bottle in your face! Hallelujah! I\\'ve done it again! Ned, you\\'re supposed to overpower her. I\\'m trying... I\\'m trying... Salt me. Heah you ah, Homah. Wha th... Why are you talking like that? The play\\'s tomorrow night. Ah\\'ve got to stay in character. Hey, Mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too? It maght. An\\' oi\\'ll talk like \\'is. Bob\\'s yer uncle, mate. That reahlly doesn\\'t help, Baht. Big Daddy, would y\\'all mind passin\\' a li\\'l ol\\' biscuit? Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver. I\\'m livin\\' in a cuckoo clock. See you later, kids. Ah\\'ve got to go rehearse with Ned. But Marge, what about dessert? For God\\'s sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding! Fine. I will! Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge! Maaaarge! Hey, Maaaaaarrrrge! Keep yelling, you big ape. Aren\\'t you being a little hard on old Homie? Forget about him. Let\\'s rehearse the bottle scene! Let\\'s not and say we did. So what time does this play start? Why? Are you going? Well I gotta, don\\'t I? I\\'m sure you won\\'t enjoy it. There\\'s nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is. Probably not much of it. Why can\\'t you be a little more supportive? Because I don\\'t care, okay? I can\\'t fake an interest in this, and I\\'m an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects. What kooky projects? You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing. Why didn\\'t you tell me you felt this way? You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night. Playing nicely, little humans? Good, good. Hello, Maggie. Poor little dummard. Hi kids! I\\'m flame retardant! If I break, buy a new one Maggie, time to go to the... Babies. Perhaps we are all a little mad, we who don the cap and bells and tread beneath the proscenium arch. But tonight, you will all be transformed from dead-eyed suburbanites into white-hot grease fires of pure entertainment! Except you, you\\'re not working out. I\\'ll be playing your part. Drag.

Everybody was cheering for you. Almost everybody. Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing. Lookin\\' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv\\'nor? Shut up boy. Marge, you were terrific. Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up. I wasn\\'t bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her. Blanche. Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her. Yeah, go on. I\\'m afraid our furnace isn\\'t working. Let\\'s get \\'em! I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that\\'s what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this. No, Homer, you got it just right. Hey, you know. I\\'m a lot like that guy. Really? Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff... Well, maybe just a little. Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la... Leggo! Leggo! I\\'m all naked and wet! Get up, Homer. It\\'s time for church. Don\\' wanna go. It\\'s church. You have to go. Too cold out! I\\'m tired of having this argument every Sunday. Get dressed. Oh, stupid itchy church pants... One size fits all, my butt! Come on. We\\'re going to be late. Forget it. I\\'m not going. Hey, where\\'s Homer? Your father is... resting. \"Resting\" hung over, \"resting\" got fired..? Help me out here. Ahhh. I\\'m just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up. I\\'m whizzing with the door open -- and I love it! Whyyy, oh whyyy... Delilahhh? It\\'s eleven KBBL degrees below zero. I hope you\\'re someplace warm. You bet your sweet... ass! Dog gone it! Yeah, what\\'s the story. But let\\'s just put it out of our minds, and turn to the Lamentation Of Jeremiah, Long Version. Joy is gone from our hearts, our dancing has turned to mourning. Who wears short shorts? I wear short shorts! The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles. Let\\'s see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke... Oooh, waffle run off. Mmm, fattening. ... and he was cast into the fiery cauldron of hell! The searing heat... the scalding rivers of molten sulfur... Ahhh... I\\'m there. Uh-oh. Here, boy. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. The service has ended. Go in Peace. The door\\'s frozen shut... and it\\'s the only way out! \"Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy...\" Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place. That was Johnny Calhoun, with \"Gonna Find Me a Genie With a Magic Bikini\". Of course, Johnny\\'s next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now! I know that! Hello, this is Homer Simpson. Homer, can you name that title? This Things I Believe. Uh... can we accept that? Woo-hoo! How\\'s that door coming, Willie? Miracles are your department, Reverend. You must be the three chiropractors I sent for. Now start manipulating my spine. Hey Moe, we don\\'t know nothin\\' about manipulatin\\'. You heard the lady - grab her spine and get cracking. Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader. Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo. Why you... Hey! Huzzah! Please, Christians, don\\'t push. Excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin\\' through... how ya doin\\'?... love that hat, baby... Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap! Let\\'s define our terms, gentleman. Are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? Because the two are by no means the same. Oh, well... can\\'t win \\'em all. We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game. Yesss! Give it a little more gas. No, no, that\\'s too much. Know what I think would help? What!? What would help!? Nothing. Oh, doctor. A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. Three visits from Morganna The Kissing Bandit... and the astonishing return of Jim Brown... Woo-hoo! Is that what I think it is? Mmm, hmm. I... found... a penny! Could this be the best day of my life? Looks like we have a new champion. Ah, my beloved family. How was church? I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church! That\\'s a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn\\'t really mean that. Like fun I don\\'t. Marge, I\\'m never going to church again. Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith? No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes. I can\\'t believe you\\'re giving up church, Homer. Hey, what\\'s the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn\\'t God everywhere? Amen, brother. And don\\'t you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week? Tell it, daddy! And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we\\'re just making God madder and madder. Testify! Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he\\'s a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways. Marge, come to bed. No, Homer. He doesn\\'t mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays... Maarge... come to bed Marge... It\\'s good for what ails ya... I can wait all -- God? THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH! Well... kind of... but... BUT WHAT? And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17. I\\'m not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I\\'m going to hell? Hmm, you\\'ve got a point there. You know, sometimes even I\\'d rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team? No. They moved to Phoenix. Oh yeah. You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons. I couldn\\'t agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I\\'ll give him a canker sore. Give him one for me. I will. So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way. Homer, it\\'s a deal. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico. Dad, can I ask you a question? Sure, honey. Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy? Don\\'t worry, Sweetheart. If I\\'m wrong, I\\'ll recant on my deathbed. Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you. Guys, please, could you give me five minutes? Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner. What?! No, it\\'s nothing bad. I\\'m just concerned, because my husband hasn\\'t been attending your services lately. Well, I wasn\\'t sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path. Oh, really? Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special \\'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge. So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What\\'d he look like? Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way. Homer, you\\'re crazy. Tell him this is all crazy. Homer, I\\'d like you to remember Matthew 7:26 -- \"The foolish man, who built his house on sand.\" \"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there\"? Yeah... think about it. Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won\\'t be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy. Pretty slick. Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It\\'s great. No Hell... no kneeling.... Sorry, Homer. I was born a Snake-Handler and I\\'ll die a Snake-Handler. Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we\\'ve made it our mission to win you back to the flock. No sale. Homer, Christian life isn\\'t all praying and sacrifice. Hey, dig this. GOD SAID TO NOAH THERE\\'S GONNA BE A FLOODY, FLOODY -- RAIN CAME DOWN... IT STARTED TO GET MUDDY, MUDDY... GET THOSE ANIMALS OUT ON THE ARKY, ARKY - Leave me alone! Dad, the heathen\\'s getting away. I see him, son. Where are we going? Garbage Island. Let\\'s go, kids. How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons? I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I\\'ll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked. Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some \"wild\" ideas and he didn\\'t always do what other people thought was right. And that man\\'s name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I\\'m talking about -- he used to drive that blue car -- Kids, could you wait outside for us? Homer, please. Don\\'t make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can\\'t win. There you go again. Always taking someone else\\'s side. Flanders... the water department... God... I\\'m only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won\\'t come with us to church? Coming up next, \"Make Your Own Ladder.\" Very sure. My friends, the devil walks among us. Ooop, I got him. No, don\\'t look for the pitchfork and pointy tail. Today\\'s devil has assumed a more seductive form, pleasing to the eye. Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that\\'s no good. Hey, now we\\'re talkin\\'. \"Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as \\'Love Springs Internal\\'.\" I don\\'t get it. Hello. I\\'m collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns. Last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of seventy-five Jewish clowns. The worst incident was during our convention in Lubbock, Texas. There were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere... it was terrible... Wait a minute, is this a religious thing? A religious clown thing, yes. Sorry. But wait... \"Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy!\" Apu, I see you\\'re not in church. Oh, but I am. I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge. Hey Ganesha, want a peanut? Please do not offer my god a peanut. No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin\\' a whiz. Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again. Pride goeth before destruction! Boy, everyone is stupid except me. Marge, turn down the heat. That\\'s better. Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE\\'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU\\'LL SEE/YOU\\'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE! Fire at the old Simpson place! You are on your honor not to steal anything. Oh, we wooon\\'t.... Little Jamshed... the store is in your hands. How I have waited for this day. You ducks are really trying my patience. But you\\'re so cute. Homer! Homer! Nooo! Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress square and true. O-kay. Flanders, you saved me. Why? Heck, you\\'d have done the same for me. Help! Help! That\\'s right, old friend. Dad! Oh, Homey! Are you all right? My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone. I saved your cat. Ow, that hurt. Hey, what are these axes for? I don\\'t know. Choppin\\' stuff. Gotcha. Truly this was an act of God. Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn\\'t save his house! Any valuables in the house? Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars... Sorry, this policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff. Well, that\\'s just great. Fire: Man\\'s oldest foe. Insatiable... remorseless... unquenchable... Hey, it\\'s out. Coming up next... Which works better - springy clothes pins, or the other kind? You know, I have a feeling there\\'s a lesson here. Yes, the lesson is... No, don\\'t tell me, I\\'ll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten! Homer, God didn\\'t set your house on fire. No, but he was working in the hearts of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid, be they Christian... Jew... or Miscellaneous... Hindu. There are 700 million of us. Ah, that\\'s super. I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am. Oh, Homie, I\\'m so glad to hear you say that. Now, would you give church another try? I\\'ll be there next Sunday. Front row, center! Don\\'t feel bad Homer. Nine out of ten religions fail in the first year. That\\'s game, Hendrix! God, I gotta ask you somethin\\'. What\\'s the meaning of life? Homer, I can\\'t tell you that. C\\'mon. You\\'ll find out when you die. I can\\'t wait that long. You can\\'t wait six months? No, tell me now! Well... okay. The meaning of life is... Principal Skinner, \"The Happiest Place on Earth\" is a registered Disneyland copyright. Gentlemen, it\\'s just a small school carnival. And it\\'s heading for a great big lawsuit. You made a big mistake, Skinner. Well, so did you. You got an ex-Green Beret mad. Copyright expired. Annnd...begin! This sucks. Haw haw! Pick the red, get ahead, pick the black, set you back. I don\\'t recall authorizing this booth. Goodbye, gentlemen. Get yer haggis, right here! Chopped heart and lungs, boiled in a wee sheep\\'s stomach! Tastes as good as it sounds. Good for what ails ya. Agh. Agh. I\\'d say... 53 years old and 420 pounds. Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239! Oh. Hey, Otto-man. I dare you to make this go faster. Ooo, challenge accepted! I\\'ll be in Mexico \\'til this thing blows over. Oh boy! A spookhouse! Hand over all your money. Was it scary? Uh-huh. Oh baby! Uh-oh. So girlie, you like roller-skatin\\'? No. Yeah, everybody loves roller-skating. Okay you can turn around now. Oh my God. I\\'m ugly. Now in a moment, we\\'ll be raffling off our grand prize... A ride on the famous Duff Beer Blimp! A ride on the Duff Blimp... You see the circular pattern on those fields? That\\'s from central-pivot irrigation. Wow. Now, let\\'s see what\\'s happening at the Super Bowl... Oops! Sorry. Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer.. But first, our second-prize winner, and the recipient of this handsome shoe buffer....... Ned Flanders! Oh, it\\'s no fair. We\\'ll never have a buffer. We have one at home. You never use it. Well, I want that one. And the winner of the blimp ride is... Homer Simpson! Oh my God! HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE. Honey, what\\'s wrong? Dad, do you think I\\'m ugly? What are you talking about? Heh heh heh... Oh, Lisa, this isn\\'t real. It\\'s just how you might look if you were a cartoon character. I\\'m an ugmo. Now that\\'s not true! You\\'re cute as a bug\\'s ear. Fathers have to say that stuff. Dad, am I cute as a bug\\'s ear? No! You\\'re homely as a mule\\'s butt! There, see? I\\'d like to be alone, please. Moe, have you ever felt unattractive? Mmmm... no. How about you, Barney? Not for a second . I need help. Whee... whee... whee.... whee... wheeeee... I guess every father thinks his daughter is the cutest. Well, now, there\\'s a way to prove it. Wow, president of Laramie Cigarettes, Jack Larson! This year, Laramie is sponsoring the Little Miss Springfield pageant. You see, government regulations prohibit us from advertising on TV. Ah, that sweet Carolina smoke. But they can\\'t prohibit us from holding a beauty pageant for little girls age seven to nine. That is so sweet. Lisa\\'s age seven to nine! Your daughter could be crowned Little Miss Springfield by our host, the Maitre d\\' of glee, Krusty the Clown! I heartily endorse this event or product. What a feeling! I\\'m as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning. That could be Lisa! The Little Miss Springfield Pageant. Only 250 dollars to enter. Hey, Barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket? Sure! Where\\'d you get all the money? From some scientists. Since they stopped testing on animals, a guy like me can really clean up. I\\'m hideous. Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up. THERE ONCE WAS AN UGLY DUCKLING... So you think I\\'m ugly? No! No! I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one. Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be? To shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again. Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant? What are you talking about? I sent in an application for you. I couldn\\'t find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates. How could you? I won\\'t do it! Homer, Lisa\\'s already sensitive about her looks. This is the last thing she needs. But I think she\\'ll win. Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba. Hey, nobody\\'s prettier than my little girl. You\\'re looking at her through a father\\'s eyes. Well, if I could gouge out somebody else\\'s eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she\\'s beautiful. Honey, no one\\'s going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant? Nope. He sold his ride on the Duff Blimp. But that ride meant everything to him! Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free -- I\\'ll do it. Did you see Tina Epstein? Whoa! If you\\'re gonna binge, you better purge. Uh oh. Amber Dempsey. In the same week she was \"Pork Princess\" and \"Little Miss Kosher.\" She\\'s beautiful. Wait. She\\'s about to bring out the big guns. Eyelash implants. I thought those were illegal. Not in Paraguay. There\\'s no way I can beat this girl. She\\'s the Jack Nicklaus of the pageant circuit. Oh, I don\\'t know that she\\'s as attractive as Jack Nicklaus... I meant because they both win all the time, Mom. Oh. Well, yes, that\\'s what I meant, too. Well, tell you what. This afternoon, I\\'ll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be. And later I\\'ll teach you the tricks of the trade: taping your swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding . Are we done? We are just warming up. Isn\\'t this dangerous? Don\\'t worry. I\\'m well protected. Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks. She\\'ll see through me like Grandma\\'s underpants. My name is Amber Dempsey, and when I grow up, I want to be a sweetie pie! No, she won\\'t. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin\\' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to \\'em, you\\'ll get plenty back in return. Like what? I\\'ll tell you when you\\'re older. Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven -- there\\'s an angel missing! And who\\'s your little school friend? Wait a minute, that\\'s Mom! I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight. Hey... hey! Whooo! Whooo! Dad, do you know anything else about women? Nope, that\\'s it. Hey brush head, you\\'ve been nursing that thing for an hour. You know, I was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure. I\\'ve misjudged you. I said step-pause-turn-pause-pivot-step-step, not step-pause-turn-pause-pivot-step-pause. Ooh, Shudder! And the winner is... Lisa Simpson! Okay, wipe away a tear... ... hug the loser... And now for your triumphant walk down the runway. It\\'s hopeless. There\\'s nothing to it. Give me those heels. Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe. Do you really think I can win? Hey, I\\'m starting to think I can win. But those other girls are prettier than me. Lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing I\\'ve ever had to say. You\\'re not ugly. Oh Bart. OUT ON OUR OWN / MAKING IT WORK / GASPING FOR AIR / HAVING IT ALL!... Oh Grampa! I am Pahasatira Mahasapeenapetilon, and tonight I will be playing MacArthur Park on the tabla. No, I\\'m serious.

Well to them I say OH BEAUTIFUL, FOR SPACIOUS SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN... One! Two! Three! Four! LEFT A GOOD JOB IN THE CITY -- WORKIN\\' FOR THE MAN EVERY NIGHT AND DAY... This is my favorite part of the pageant, because... whazzat say?... Oh, it gives me a chance to visit with the girls personality, uh, personally. Amber, \"Do you think the Bill of Rights is a good thing or a bad thing?\" Um... Take your time, dear. ... Good thing. Awwww... Ver-ry \"Wrigley\". As Little Miss Springfield, it\\'s my pleasure to welcome you to America, the Land of Opportunity. And now it\\'s time to name our runner-up, who if the winner doesn\\'t fulfill her duties, blah blah blah wuzza wuzza wuzza. And don\\'t say \"It\\'ll never happen\", because we all remember that thing with whatsername... Click Click You know... Okay, the runner-up is... Lisa Simpson, which means Amber Dempsey is the new Little Miss Springfield! L THE LOSERS IN HER WAKE / \"I\" THE INCOME SHE WILL MAKE / \"T\" IS FOR HER TOOTH-FILLED MOUTH... / \"T\" IS FOR HER TOOTH-FILLED MOUTH... Coming up next, a new fad that\\'s sweeping the nation. Wasting food. But first, let\\'s join the new Little Miss Springfield, Amber Dempsey, as she helps open the Danish super-chain \"SHOP\". Scott, everyone is here, from the Mayor\\'s illegitimate son to our own Duff Blimp. Hey, can I drive? Well, I can\\'t see the harm. Oh, the humanity. Anyway, to turn on the store\\'s severe tire damage spikes, here\\'s Little Miss Springfield. Oh dear. It would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet. I\\'d say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. Unless it\\'s made out of plastic. Nope. Metal. Ladies and Gentlemen. Little Miss Springfield has been struck by lightning! Doctor, what is Amber\\'s condition? Oh she\\'ll be fine. In fact, she\\'s already won the Little Miss Intensive Care Pageant. Congratulations Lisa. You\\'re the new Little Miss Springfield. Here\\'s your scepter. Just kidding. Here you go. Just kidding. I deserved that. That doesn\\'t look like her body. The torso used to be Dr. Ruth. Her head is on a pike in the chamber of horrors. Hi fellas. Love that \"chewing gum\" walk. Actually, they\\'re being deported. And now, let\\'s give a big Fort Springfield welcome to Mr. Bob Hope. What\\'s the mayor\\'s name? Quimby. Beautiful. Hello, this is Bob \"what the hell am I doing in Springfield\" Hope. Hey, how about that Mayor Quimby? He\\'s some golfer! His golf balls spends more time under water than Greg Louganis. And now, I want to show you what you\\'re fighting for -- if there was a war on -- Little Miss Springfield. Isn\\'t she beautiful? Little Miss Springfield?! First Tony Randall cancels - now this. Hey, set me down at that boat show. I\\'m going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes? Mm hm. We think you\\'re the perfect spokesmodel for Laramies. It\\'s part of our new campaign. Hmm classy. Y\\'see, Lisa, it\\'s been an unlucky year for Laramie. A lot of the people who smoke our product have been... well... dying, heh heh. And we need young smokers to take their place. I don\\'t want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company! But you\\'re a role model to young people. And we\\'re thinking of retiring \"Menthol Moose\". Bless you boys. Homer, those are ice cream men. I know. Stop this float! What\\'s the holdup? Go! I\\'m tired of being a corporate shill. From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes. Before I sing the National Anthem, I\\'d like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts. Let\\'s get outta here! Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out, and Amber Dempsy back in. But this glorified-crossing-guard-of-a-Police Chief won\\'t get off his big fat can. Is it okay if I open these potato chips? Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered. Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield\\'s pageant application. Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne. And some dip for these chips... somethin\\'. Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield. She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today. Well, that\\'s obviously the wrong footage. Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson, filled out the pageant application incorrectly. In the area under \"Do not write in the space\" he wrote \"okay.\" If it wasn\\'t for me you\\'d still be queen. You must hate me. Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant? I don\\'t know. Was I drunk? Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do. Really? Uh-huh. Will you remember this the next time I wreck your life? It\\'s a deal. And now, my exclusive interview with his Holiness, Pope John Paul II. That\\'s it. I cannot work under these conditions. If anybody wants me, I\\'ll be downstairs at McDougals. Call the weekend guy, I don\\'t care. Happy birthday, Bart. Thanks, Grampa. Where\\'d you get all the money? The government. I didn\\'t earn it. I don\\'t need it. But if they miss one payment, I\\'ll raise hell. Hey Homer - where\\'s your present? Oh yeah? With what? I mean don\\'t worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father\\'s grave... Hey! I will get you one now! Do you sell toys? We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt! Well, I need something for my son\\'s birthday. Perhaps this will please the gentleman. Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse. Ooh, that\\'s bad. But it comes with a free frogurt. That\\'s good. The frogurt is also cursed. That\\'s bad. But you get your choice of topping. That\\'s good. The toppings contain potassium benzoate. That\\'s bad. Can I go now? Happy birthday, son! Great Caesar\\'s Ghost! A talking Krusty doll! I\\'m Krusty the Clown and I love you very much. Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I\\'ve ever had. That doll is evil, I tells ya. Evil! EEEVIL! Grampa, you said that about all the presents. I just want attention. ...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield\\'s air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly. Woo hoo! I\\'m Krusty the Clown and I don\\'t like you. I\\'m Krusty the Clown and I\\'m going to kill you! Didn\\'t even pull the string that time. I said I\\'m going to kill you. You, Homer Simpson. Homer, what\\'s wrong? That doll tried to kill me! I\\'d say that the pressure\\'s finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure? Don\\'t leave me alone with him. MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT\\'S H-O-M-E-R. There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality. Hey, baby. Get comfortable. Relax. It\\'s a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don\\'t you think? You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well... they are making me dizzy... Goodbye, Dolly. Arrivederci, Vito. I was a fool to think anyone would want nude pictures of Whoopi Goldberg. What the?... And that is that. Guess who, Fat Boy? Marge, Marge, look! Oh my God. The doll\\'s trying to kill me and the toaster\\'s been laughing at me! Ew. Dog water. Your doll is trying to kill my husband!... Yes, I\\'ll hold. EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN / SO WHY DON\\'T YOU? Yep. Here\\'s your problem. Someone set this thing to \"EVIL\". I love you, Homer. Come here you. Here ya\\' go buddy. Did you walk the dog? Yeah, he buried me a couple a times. Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk. Yeah, you stupid idiot. Oh, what a day. Homer made me give him a sponge bath. But coming home to you makes it all worth while. Here, let me get that for ya. ... So then, his wife comes through the door!!! So? Did I mention she was dead? No. Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club! And? Don\\'t you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her. You said he went bowling! Homer, I\\'ve coughed up scarier stuff than that. Grampa, why don\\'t you tell us a story? You\\'ve led an interesting life. That\\'s a lie and you know it. But I have seen a lot of movies... My name is Marge Bouvier. I\\'m here about your ad. Single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. Must like monkeys. Non-smoker preferred. Well, you\\'d be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors. Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! Arrr! What do you think Smithers? I think women and seamen don\\'t mix. We know what you think. Young lady, you\\'re hired. Hey, I heard we\\'re going to Ape Island. Yeah, to capture a giant ape. I wish we were going to Candy Apple Island. Candy Apple Island, what have they got there? Apes. But they\\'re not so big. Hey, who\\'s this Homer Dude? He\\'s either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we\\'re going ashore. Am I going too? Garsh darn it. Of course. We wouldn\\'t think of going without the bait... uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty -- The bathing beauty. I covered that up pretty well. HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... Just try to remain inconspicuous. HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... HOMER... Mose tatupu! Mose tatupu! What\\'s he saying? Uh, he\\'s saying, \"We wouldn\\'t dream of sacrificing the blue-haired woman!\" Oh, well, isn\\'t that... Whoa! Smithers, this is a golden opportunity. If we get him alive we can put him on Broadway. Dead, we\\'ll sell monkey stew to the Army! Ooo. You keep your hands to yourself, mister. Now, we don\\'t want to kill him, shoot him around the groin and belly. Hey Homer, cut it out. Come on, quit eatin\\' me. Ow! Nice shot, Carl. All right, you big ape, get a snootful of this gas bomb. I WAS STROLLING THROUGH THE GAS ONE DAY... Nice work, Smithers. When we get back, I\\'m giving you a raise. Oh well. What kinda show you got for us, Mr. Burns? Well, the ape\\'s going to stand around for three hours or so. Then we\\'ll close with the ethnic comedy of Douggan an Dershowitz. Sensational! Hi fellow Halloweenies! Did I scaredly-dare ya? Ladies and gentlemen, in his native land he was a king. But he comes before you in chains, for your own amusement. Presenting Homer, the Eighth Wonder of the World! Wow! Look at the size of that platform! I think you\\'re making him angry. Come on, what\\'s he gonna do, run amok in downtown Springfield? Hey monkey, want a peanut? I said one! ON THE GOOD SHIP, LOLLIPOP / IT\\'S A SWEET TRIP TO A CANDY SHOP...WHERE BON-BONS... I am dreading the reviews, I can tell you that. Oh hi, Homie. He\\'s sure taking his sweet time. Better refuel. You know, you look a little flushed. Maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people. He\\'s not dead. No, but his career is. I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building. After that, he couldn\\'t get arrested in this town. Don\\'t worry, Homie. I\\'ll take care of you. Are you with the bride or groom? Right this way. Folks, if you could just stop cleaning each other for a second... Wait! Wait! Marge, I can\\'t find your father. Oh, Homer. Now kids, instead of candy, I thought I\\'d serve an array of healthy fresh fruits. Fruit is nature\\'s candy! Whoa! Nice try, Mr. Flanders, but I\\'ve got a story so scary you\\'ll wet your pants. Too late. From A-Apple to Z-Zebra, \"Baby\\'s First Pop-Up Book\" is twenty-six pages of alphabetic adventure. Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers? Well, most of it. You have to read another book. Find Waldo Yet Again. Man, he\\'s just not tryin\\' anymore. Gee, never noticed that before! Whoa! Ow! What\\'s this? Evil... Evil... Bad... Beware... Beware... Cool. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Chapter eight, \"Let\\'s Talk Zombies...\" If a zombie bites you, you become a zombie. You must walk the earth feeding on the brains of the living until the spell is broken. Bart, please. Don\\'t you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the Mayor\\'s beer swilling brother, Clovis. Hey, maybe there\\'s a spell in here that\\'ll bring her back from the dead. Let\\'s see what we\\'ve got... \"How to Get Your Skeletons Their Whitest\"... \"Selling Your Soul in a Buyer\\'s Market\"... Ah, here we are, \"How to Raise The Dead.\" Cullen, Rayburn, Narz, Trebek! Zabar, Kresge, Caldor, Walmart! It\\'s not working. Bart! You cast the wrong spell! Zombies! Please Lis, they prefer to be called the Living Impaired. There. Pretty as a picture. Ach! Zombies. There. Pretty as a picture. Well, howdy strangers! What can I do ya for? Brains... Brains... Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and-- Dad, we did something very bad. Did you wreck the car? No. Did you raise the dead? Yes. But the car is okay? Uh huh. All right then. Martin Prince, report to my office at once! And bring that big, juicy, Chess Club brain of yours along with you! Hey kids, look what you can win in the Krusty Sweepstakes! To enter, send me your parents\\' brains, or write \"PARENTS\\' BRAINS\" on a 3-by-5 card, and send it to... Homer, did you barricade the door? Why? Oh, the zombies. No. Spare my family. Take me. Take me! Brains! Brains! I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. How wrong I was. I should have never read that book. Wait Bart! Maybe the library has another book that\\'ll reverse the spell. It\\'s our only hope. To the book depository! Hey Simpson, I\\'m feeling a mite peckish. Mind if I chew your ear? Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders! He was a zombie? KZMB! All zombie radio. The zombies have the earthlings on the run. I\\'m a-comin\\' boy! Soon, the human race will wither and fall, like the earth plums we have seen on the observascope. Ow... careful... not the face. Barney! Not you, too! I\\'m not a zombie. But hey, when in Rome... Wow, George Washington. Take that Washington! Eat lead, Einstein! Show\\'s over, Shakespeare! Is this the end of zombie Shakespeare? Hurry, Bart! Kolchak, Mannix, Banacek, Danno! What\\'s wrong? Uh, I never realized what a beautiful young woman you\\'ve become. Ah. Trojan, Ramses, Magnum, Sheik! See ya in hell. / Still pushin\\' that boulder? / Uh-huh. Excuse me. I\\'m John Smith. John Smith, 1882? My mistake. The uh zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in our streets. Yay! Well, I\\'m sure glad we didn\\'t turn into mindless zombies. Shh! TV! Man... fall down. Funny. Captain\\'s log Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up. The ship is drafty and damp. I complain but nobody listens. \"Star Trek XII - So Very Tired.\" See the original cast in their latest, greatest adventure. Captain, Klingons off the starboard bow! Again with the Klingons. Mr. Scott, give me full power. Homer, get back here. It\\'s no good, Captain, I canna\\' reach the control panel! Movies! What a rip-off. I don\\'t have to sit here and take this. I... . Hubba hubba! Oh you kid! Thank you, dear. Now be good for Grampa while we\\'re at the parent/ teacher meeting. We\\'ll bring back dinner. What are we going to have? Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you\\'ve been good... pizza. If you\\'ve been bad... uh... ... let\\'s see... poison. What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad? Poison pizza. Oh no. I\\'m not making two stops. All right, I\\'ll talk to Lisa\\'s teacher this year. You can have Bart\\'s. That\\'s the way we do it every year. All right. Tell you what. I\\'m thinking of a number between one and 50. Is it 37? I mean, no. Homer! Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please? Oh, all right. Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A! Ach. Hee hee! Bart has been guilty of the following atrocities: synthesizing a laxative from peas and carrots, replacing my birth-control pills with Tic Tacs... Well, I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sure Bart doesn\\'t really mean to be bad. Now\\'s our chance to be bad. Mr. Simpson... I just wanted to tell you that you\\'ve done a wonderful job with Lisa. You must have read to her at a young age. I did. I did read to her! I\\'m starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick! Eight o\\'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he\\'s losing his cool. Well, I\\'ve always been a firm believer in the three \"R\\'s\": \"reading TV Guide\"... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide. Now, we don\\'t usually do this, but we have some witnesses. Come in, Arthur. Now where did Bart stick the fireworks? Oh... Over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here I come. Ew! \"My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary.\" You know, I never thought I\\'d find a replacement for my \"Where\\'s the Beef\" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... \"Where\\'s the Beef\". Uh... we\\'d like the desk back Mr. Simpson. Huh? Oh. I really don\\'t see how this helps Bart. Just do it. Bus-ted! Homer, we have a problem here. Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won\\'t stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa! We\\'re talking about Bart. Oh. That guy. I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him. Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we\\'ve punished him when actually we\\'ve completely caved in. He\\'s the boy you love to hate. Well, you\\'ve got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Yeah, right. Like you\\'re gonna let me go hungry. I\\'ll be eatin\\' that pizza in five minutes. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger. And what if we don\\'t? Then there\\'s no telling how low he can sink. All right, ladies. Prepare to be blown away by \"Bang-Bang Bart!\" You\\'re fat! Just more of me to love, honey. Oh, my poor baby. Uh oh. What? Whazzat? Hi mom. Hi dad. Home already? Boy, time really flies when you\\'re reading... The Bible? Ew. Well, we brought some pizza. If you don\\'t start making more sense we\\'re gonna have to put you in a home. You already put me in a home. Then we\\'ll put you in the crooked home we saw on \"60 Minutes.\" I\\'ll be good. Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth! Dad, you and your stories... \"Bart broke my teeth\"... \"the nurses are stealing my money\"... \"this thing on my neck is getting bigger\"... Now this is exactly what Bart\\'s teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way. But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He\\'s learned his lesson. Let\\'s get him a present. Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy? All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa\\'s teeth -- he gets to break yours. Oh, this is gonna be sweet. No, no, no. Oh. Bart, we\\'re sending you to bed without your supper. Bart! Stop being confident. There must be something to eat around here. Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I\\'d better straighten up and fly... Bart, don\\'t tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza. Just promise me you\\'ll try to be good. I promise. Thataboy. Sucker. Well, well. If it isn\\'t the tooth fairy. Coming for Christmas... the Itchy & Scratchy Movie! Bart! Stick around, Mr. Bond. Things are really starting to \"cook.\" Bart, come quick! There\\'s an Itchy and Scratchy MOVIE!!! If you want suspense...romance...you\\'ll find it in the Itchy & Scratchy Movie. Coming soon to a theater near you. 53% new footage. Wow. Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked? Indeed I did. Hey you goats, get outta here! Boy, you\\'re going to have to be punished for this. Dad, you could punish me. But that means you\\'d have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it... Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms. Ayy, el estomago! Run along, ya little scamp. Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells... Bart! Why are you doing that? I\\'unno. Well, this time you must be punished. Well, you could punish me, but... No tricks, boy. I said I\\'m gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute... Ice cream truck! Me, me. I was here first! Now, what were we talking about, boy? Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty. Oh yeah. The trick is to say you\\'re prejudiced against all races. We\\'re home. We got beets! Bart, are you pulling up the carpet? Yuh - huh. Why are you letting him do this? I\\'unno. Well punish him! All right. All right. Bart, go to your room. See ya in the funny pages. How could you let this happen? How could you let this happen? I wasn\\'t here! Oh. How convenient. Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper? Can\\'t he be both like the late Earl Warren? Earl Warren wasn\\'t a stripper. Now who\\'s being naive. Look, you have to help discipline your son. All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I\\'ll punish him and make it stick. Tonight on Eye On Springfield, we meet a man who\\'s been hiccuping for forty-five years. Kill me... Kill me... But first we\\'ll examine the growing Itchy & Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today! I got my ticket. I\\'m here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let\\'s take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole. It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled \"That Happy Cat\". Sorry, but the punishment stands. The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here\\'s their first cartoon together: \"Steamboat Itchy.\" Oh me, oh my! During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe. We\\'ll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat. Bart, didn\\'t I ask you to watch Maggie? Sounds like something you\\'d say. Hey, where is she? Oh my Lord! Aw, isn\\'t that cute. A baby driving a car. And look, there\\'s a dog driving a bus. Hey! All rrright. Time for a crime spree. All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I\\'ve ever handed down. And this time it\\'s gonna stick! Come on, Homer. This isn\\'t funny. Damn right. Bart, you can\\'t go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever! Oh, nnnooo. Beta. Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Can\\'t you just give me a spanking? Come on, go nuts. Don\\'t point that thing at me. I said you\\'re not going to the movie and I\\'m sticking to it. Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn\\'t watch the moon landing? Hmm... YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I\\'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN\\' YOU... ... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING... I regret nothing! Someday you\\'ll thank me for this, son. Not bloody likely. No, it\\'s true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher\\'s mitt. But, my dad wouldn\\'t get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage. Dad, what\\'s the point of this story? I like stories. Look, can I please go to the movie? I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can\\'t go back on it. You\\'re welcome to watch anything you want on TV. TV sucks. I know you\\'re upset right now, so I\\'ll pretend you didn\\'t say that. The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour. I\\'m not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can\\'t compare to the imagination of a small boy. How was it? It wasn\\'t that great. Be honest. It was the greatest movie I\\'ve ever seen in my life. And you wouldn\\'t believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didn\\'t use their real names, but you could tell it was them. Lisa. Sorry Bart. It\\'s just not the same. I\\'ve seen the Itchy & Scratchy Movie 13 times. I\\'ve seen it 17 times. You guys must be gettin\\' pretty tired of that movie by now. No one who saw the movie would say that! Let\\'s get him! Homer, we\\'d like to talk to you. But then I won\\'t be watching TV. You can see the bind I\\'m in. Dad, you\\'ve got to let Bart see that movie. I\\'ve never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine. Don\\'t you think I know that? Well, it\\'s been two months. You laid down the law and I\\'m proud of you. But I think we\\'ve gotten through to him. Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can\\'t see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a \"Mister Tight Buns\" competition. I can\\'t let that happen, I won\\'t let that happen and I can\\'t let that happen. One for \"Itchy and Scratchy\". We promised your dad we wouldn\\'t. I\\'m here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards, the Itchy and Scratchy movie is showing for the last time. Tomorrow, a new movie, starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open. Will it be as successful? Only time will tell. Well, Dad, I guess you won. No, son, we both won. You don\\'t know it now, but I\\'ve started you on the road to somewhere very special. Well, I\\'ll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie. Come on. What d\\'ya say? All right. I think you\\'ve learned your lesson. One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I\\'ll get it son. That\\'ll be six hundred and fifty dollars. One Soylent Green. Hold the butter. Mmm... Soylent Green. Which one\\'s the mouse? Itchy. Itchy\\'s a jerk. Yeah. Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of \"Lemon Time\"... Oooh, give it here. Homer, that\\'s dish washing liquid! Yeah, but what\\'re ya gonna do? Oooh! They\\'re having a retirement party for someone at the plant. I wish I could retire. Boy, that\\'d be sweet. Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I\\'d fire up the briar. Can\\'t talk -- busy. Okely-dokely-do. Did you notice how slanted he looked? All part of God\\'s great plan. I think one side of our house is sinking. Haw haw! The half-assed approach to foundation repair. Hello, I\\'m Troy McClure. You might remember me from such instructional videos as \"Mothballing Your Battleship\" and \"Dig Your Own Grave - and Save!\" Now over the next six hours I\\'ll be taking you through the do\\'s and do not do\\'s of foundation repair. Ready? Ready! First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel... Hand me my patching trowel, boy. Hmm. Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation? No. Good. Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws. Install. Wha-do I do... After applying brushable coating to the panels... Wait a minute... ....you\\'ll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath. Wait a minute... If you can\\'t find metal stucco lath.... Uh huh? Use carbon-fiber stucco lath. Now, parge the lath... Did you see the bubble? A CERTAIN MAN... A CERTAIN MAN... I\\'m afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. I figure it\\'s gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred. Forget it. You\\'re not the only foundation guy in town! Let\\'s see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are... ... Leaving the Vice President in charge. And now, Leaning Tower of Pisa eat your heart out and move over! This is one story that\\'s not on the level! Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet \"Cue Ball,\" the man with no hair! Huh? He\\'s hideous! We have to do something... Marge, it\\'ll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need. I could get a job. Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts. March 15... I wish I\\'d brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV. Hmm, I think you have to keep your job too. It was the most beautiful, most expensive train ever built, the \"Spruce Caboose\". Some people said it was too big to stay on the tracks... heh, heh, they were right. We\\'re here for the retirement party. Follow the Headless Brakeman. Power plant retirement party. Ow! Right this way. Tonight, we\\'ve all come to honor a close friend of ours... Bo-ring! A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley. Bo-ring. Mr. Burns, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ve prepared a little musical number for Jack\\'s special night. THERE IS A MAN... THERE IS A MAN... A MAN WHOSE GRACE / AND HANDSOME FACE / ARE KNOWN ACROSS THE LAND! / YOU KNOW HIS NAME... YOU KNOW HIS NAME... IT\\'S MISTER BURNS! HE\\'S MISTER BURNS! HE LOVES A SMOKE/ ENJOYS A JOKE AH HA-HA-HA-HA WHY, HE\\'S WORTH TEN TIMES WHAT HE EARNS! HE\\'S MISTER BURNS! I\\'M MISTER BURNS! HE\\'S MONTY BURNS! I\\'m Mister Burns! TO FRIENDS HE\\'S KNOWN AS MONTY, BUT TO YOU IT\\'S MISTER... BURNS!! BUR-BUR-BUR-BUR-BUR-BURNS!! Burns! Do you mind if I say a few words? Oh, me, me, me \"I need all the attention just because it\\'s my party, eh!\" Please don\\'t make me retire! My job is the only thing that keeps me alive! I never married, and my dog is dead! I\\'m not finished. Oh, yes you are. With the departure of Mr. Marley, there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G. Now get out. The bar is closed. Maybe I should apply for that job. Where does the Bible say \"racket?\".... It\\'s in there. Look, Marge we just don\\'t need the money that bad. Well, Lisa, I finished my resume. Uh... I think it needs a little padding. What are you putting in there?... Up-up-up. When I\\'m done. Chauffeur... seamstress... curator of large mammals? Marge have you seen my lunch box? Oh, I see. Mom, they expect you to lie a little. Worked for the Carter administration? Well, you voted for him... twice! Lisa, sh! Someone may be listening. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh, I thought Muddy Waters wrote that song. This resume is very impressive. Let me be the first to say: Kadibu [kadeeboo] Kazini [kazeenee]. What? Welcome aboard. I guess my Swahili\\'s not as good as yours. Yeah... Sorry, the position has been filled. Oh dear. Marge, you\\'re making a big mistake. I\\'m going to see you all day at work and all night at home... And that\\'s good! But, here\\'s the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: \"Canada To Hold Referendum.\" Sorry Marge, can\\'t talk now. We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah\\'s Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn\\'t let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade. Yeah, lemonade is good. I think it\\'s wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You\\'ll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie. Wha dey do? They discovered radium. Then they both died of radiation poisoning. Hmmm! It\\'s the Curies. We must flee! Cool! Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can\\'t speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt . Maggie, your baby-sitter\\'s here. What\\'s that mean? Whoa, you must be sick. Whoa, you must be sick. Let\\'s see. What\\'s old doc Washburn prescribe? Do you have Dropsy? The Grippe? Scrofula? The Vapors? Jungle Rot? Dandy Fever? Poor man\\'s gout? Housemaid\\'s knee? Climactic pooball? The staggers? Dum-dum fever?... And this is your office. That idiot Tibor lost the key, but you can jimmy it open with a credit card. Well, have fun. But... what do I do? Marge, please. According to your resume, you invented this machine. Put away your books, children. It\\'s time for your English test. Sick... on test day... Why? Whyyy? Bart, have you ever read \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\"? I\\'m halfway through it, I swear! Marge what\\'re you doing? It\\'s lunch time. I\\'ll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork. Marge, Marge, Marge, let\\'s file this under \"R\" for arrivederci. But, where does it go? Don\\'t worry, baby. That tube\\'ll know what to do. Good news, boy. I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn\\'t exactly a pharmacy... more of a bait shop. Look, Grampa, I\\'m fine! I really don\\'t need any more home remedies. Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, \\'cause this is mighty cold. Aaaagh! Jackanapes... lolligaggers... noodle heads... enchantress! That woman -- she\\'s so captivating. Smithers, my heart\\'s pounding like a jackhammer. Marge, get my gun. I must have her. Smithers, zoom in. Closer... Closer... closer, damn it! Ow! Too close. Hello! Mr. Burns! No need for alarm. I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees. Oh, aren\\'t you nice. Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low. I am the angel of death. The time of purification is at hand. Oh, who cares. Marge, what can we do? Well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days... You mean like \"Child labor Day\"? Hmm, actually, I was thinking of \"Funny Hat Day.\" Oh, and how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up. It\\'s working! It\\'s working! And the healthy snacks are on their way. You can\\'t take our donuts! All right, anyone else want to be a hero? Marge, I\\'m giving you a raise and a new office... right next to mine. But, sir, that\\'s my office! Don\\'t worry Smithers, I\\'m putting you where the action is. Springtime fresh, winter white... what could be better? Oh, man, I really gotta... Nooo! So, Bart, how are you feeling? Can\\'t complain. Well, then you\\'re ready for your make up test. Aagh! My ovaries! Suckers. Have you ever read \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf?\" I glanced at it... boy cries \"wolf\"... has a few laughs... I forget how it ends. Bart, is that light green? Yeah. It better be! Homie, what\\'s wrong? I\\'m used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it\\'d be my own wife. Well, maybe you\\'d get promoted if you worked a little harder. Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver. Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around. Well, I won\\'t sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I\\'m lazy. I\\'m gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight. I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you\\'re in bed and they fly in through the window? You\\'ve been reading my Wish Book, sir. Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate. Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson? Uh, you remember we did that once before? Oh, that\\'s right, he\\'s dead. And rather pungent. The rest of that night is something I\\'d like to forget. All right, then. Bring me that crooner she likes so much... Tom Jones. These spurs are killin\\' me. Ayyy -- sit on it. Lenny, 50\\'s Day is next Wednesday. I gotta go home and change! Here\\'s your money. You know the problem here was water leakage. If you just buy a fifty cent washer -- I\\'ve got a better idea -- get the hell out! Look, I\\'ve got some washers in my truck. I\\'ll give you one. Tom Jones? Yes? I was wondering if you\\'d be interested in performing at a private party. Sorry, Mate, I don\\'t do private parties. Then, perhaps you should look in this suitcase. All right, but I don\\'t see... Pleasant dreams, Mr. Jones. Bart, to avoid this test you\\'ve had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabbies. Well, I\\'m not sure I\\'m over it. Shove it, witch. No more excuses! Her claws are really digging into my skull. She can crush clams with them. Get it off, get it off! Here we have an Alaskan Timber Wolf. He weighs 240 pounds and his jaws can bite through a parking meter. He does get spooked by loud noises. Loud? That\\'s our secret word for the day! Oh my God! She must think you\\'re after her eggs. I only ate one! Nice doggie. Ivanhoe is the story of a Russian farmer and his tool. Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to do better than that. Sorry. No sale. You\\'re wasting valuable test time. Mr. Burns, you want to see me? Actually, I was wondering if you were free for a little get-together tonight. Dinner, dancing and ... Mr. Tom Jones. Hello, Marge. That\\'s it... big smile ... everybody\\'s happy. Oh my goodness! My husband will be so excited. You... have a husband? Yes, I can picture him now... rugged good looks... sweater knotted about his shoulders... curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold... Homer, Mr. Burns gave me another raise today. The senile old fool. You\\'re fired! You can\\'t fire me just because I\\'m married. I\\'m going to sue the pants off you. You don\\'t have to sue me to get my pants off. Hey, Wolfie, put down that hors d\\'oeuvre... It\\'s time for the main course! Back to class, lad, nothin\\' to see here. Here\\'s my test. Bart, I\\'m not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there. The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. I\\'m just going to lie on the floor now. Please don\\'t let me swallow my tongue. There, doesn\\'t it feel better to tell the truth? Oh dear. All right, now boy, we\\'ve got to rub some garlic on you before the next full moon. Don\\'t feel bad for losing. I was wrestlin\\' wolves back when you were at your mother\\'s teat. Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head -- you\\'re a mess, woman . So, do you think I have a case? Mrs. Simpson, you\\'re in luck. Your sexual harassment suit is just the thing I need to rebuild my shattered practice. Care to join me in a belt of scotch? It\\'s 9:30 in the morning. Yeah, but I haven\\'t slept in days... Last chance... Oh, yeah. Mr. Burns we\\'ve got witnesses, precedent and a paper trail a mile long. Yes, well, I have ten high-priced lawyers. He left his briefcase. Hey! It\\'s full of shredded newspapers. Well, I guess that\\'s it. People like us can\\'t afford justice. Come on Homie, let\\'s go before he fires you too. No! Mr. Burns, I\\'m not leaving until you say you\\'re sorry for what you did to my wife. You love her, too. Damn right! Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life. Gotcha. Marge, we\\'re gettin\\' some drive-thru then we\\'re doin\\' it twice. No, I\\'ve got something even more special in mind. oooh... Get help, Luv. Call Interpol, get me a hacksaw -- anything. O.K., Ron, which one of our girls said the following about you: \"He looked so sexy, I hoped we would have sex.\" Well, that\\'s a tough one \\'cause I did the deed with Uta, Candi, and Shasta. Hee hee! It\\'s true, all right! Huh, huh, but, I\\'m going to have to go with Shasta \\'cause she liked makin\\' bacon on the beach. Ooh, me too. Ahhh, bacon. Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move... Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh? Yes, well, there\\'s a few things you could do to help us sell our home. First, whenever you walk in front of your window could you please wear pants? Mmm... no. Second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens. Mmm... no. And please cover your garbage. It\\'s attracting wildlife. Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin\\' to you! Get off my lawn! Now! Hello, what\\'s this? Wire hangers! Expired medicine! Old newspapers! Okay Homer, stay calm. Just quietly get this stuff inside your house. Homer, you\\'re not listening! That medicine\\'s not for you. Come on, Marge. Maybe I\\'m not getting enough ...estrogen. Gimme that. Ahoy, maties. Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at the \"FRYIN\\' DUTCHMAN.\" Is it more iced tea ye be needing? Okay. Set sail for \"The Fryin\\' Dutchman.\" Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we\\'re going to that restaurant. But I think I\\'m allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions. Mmmm, shrimp. Now, I don\\'t know much about haggling or bargaining, so why don\\'t we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want? That could work. What was that? Sigh. There you are! Thought you could get away, huh? Goodbye. I don\\'t think we should be down here. Nervous, Lis? I don\\'t blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son. Bart! The Winfields didn\\'t have a son. See that sock over there? It was his only friend. Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you won\\'t need those eyes. Let me have them. Bart, that\\'s not funny. There are some who say the monster... ... is still... here! Aaah! Friend... friend... Hey kid, wake up. Who are you? I\\'m Laura - your new neighbor. You all right? I fell on my bottom. Not again. My mother\\'s inside, Mrs. Simpson. Please go right on in. Oh, you speak so politely to adults. My upbringing was painfully strict, ma\\'am. That\\'s sweet. ... and finally, Moe\\'s Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying \"Welcome to Springfield.\" Thank you, this is all so nice. I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield. Especially after that Time cover story, \"America\\'s Worst City.\" You could see our house in that photo. Oh. And this is for the man of the house... which I guess... is you. I guess I should explain. Laura\\'s father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they\\'re so sweet when you marry them, but soon it\\'s just career, career, career. My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don\\'t look that way. I bet you don\\'t know this one. How\\'d you like a Hertz Donut? Oh. Hurts, don\\'t it? ...All you can eat, ha! Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is? Is it this? Hey baby, how about putting your finger in my ear? Well, I don\\'t know, your boyfriend looks like the jealous type. Hey, what the -- That chick\\'s messin\\' with our minds. Let\\'s get outta here. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, I was gonna tell your fortune. Huh? Oh, man, you\\'re gonna be rich! Whoa! There\\'s your mansion. There\\'s the tennis court... and there\\'s the swimming pool! See you later, Bart! I\\'ll never wash this hand again. Dad, make Bart wash his hand. Sorry, Lis, I no longer control the hand. The hand controls me. Daad! Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you\\'d like to baby-sit my little angels. Sorry, this isn\\'t Abbie, this is her sister. I look after her now. No, Bart, put it down. Put it down, Bart. Bart, put it down... No \"All You Can Eat Seafood.\" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing! Maybe Laura could watch us. Oh, I get it. Bart, the baby-sitter\\'s here. Let me tuck you in. Silence! Maybe it\\'s time I wash my hand. I\\'ll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home. Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around... My divorce. That\\'s it! Whew, I\\'m glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing. Homer. Well I know what you\\'re thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites. Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we\\'re not talking about food. I\\'m not. Right. Me neither. We\\'re talkin\\' about sex, right? Right. I hear you loud and clear. Bart, are you taking a bath? Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change. This wouldn\\'t have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it? Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest. Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise. Cute. What do you guys want for dinner? I don\\'t care. Ask Hef over there. Lady\\'s choice. Sometimes I think you want to fail. Shut up. Just shut up. We used to eat this when my dad was stationed in Vandahar. Take your Kafta B-Sanieh and dip it in the Labneh. Now that is good Labneh. I\\'m sorry, ma\\'am, but everything on the menu has fish in it. Hm, what about the bread? Does that have much fish in it? Yes. Well, I have some Tic Tacs in my purse... Excellent choice... and for the gentleman? All you can eat. All you can eat. All right. When you\\'re ready, take this plate over... Please don\\'t take the steam tray, sir. C\\'mon Bart, if I can teach Maggie to waltz, I can teach you. Just follow me. Put your hand on my hip. O-kay. Wedgie! Whoa. That man ate all our shrimp and two plastic lobsters! \\'Tis no man. \\'Tis a remorseless eating machine. Arrrr... Six bells, time for closin\\'. Can\\'t talk... eating. Fairly warned be thee, says I. Hey, hey, hey! But the sign said \"All you can eat.\" I\\'m gonna fight this thing. Oh, please don\\'t. For me? Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I\\'m like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills... Don Quixote? No, that\\'s not it. What\\'s his name? The Man of La Mancha. Don Quixote. No! I really think that was the character\\'s name... Don Quixote! Fine. I\\'ll look it up. Well, who was it? Never mind. Mmhmmm. Oh no! Here comes the \"Conservative Judge!\" Plead insanity! Plead insanity! It\\'s not working! All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now! Oh no. You\\'re in Texas! If I\\'d hit the \"remorse\" button one more time, I would have made it. Ah, Bart, I gotta go. See ya around. I am thinking you like this girl, yes? How did you know? My ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than who is about to shoot me. Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film \"The Neverending Story.\" So you think I have a case? Homer, I don\\'t use the word \"hero\" very often. But you are the greatest hero in American history. Woo hoo! I\\'m here to see my Grampa. Here I am, sonny. You\\'re not my Grampa. Ah, c\\'mon, give me a chance. Hey, can your grandfather do this? Bart! Ah, you remembered my birthday. Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here\\'s a bus schedule. Wow! Fits right in my pocket! Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman? I had a crush on the oldest woman. One hundred and twenty years old, she was. Here\\'s a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake. What happened? She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd. Suddenly, she didn\\'t have any time for me. I wore a 15 pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn\\'t enough. Dad, I have some questions about women. Uhh... can\\'t you see I\\'m reading the uh... ..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town. Homer, Bart\\'s at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know. But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did. Are you sure...? Maybe you\\'re right. Now, if you\\'ll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father. Dad, if there\\'s a really special girl and she likes some clod who\\'s beneath her, what should you do? Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They\\'re about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you\\'d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can\\'t stop at one. You want to drink another woman! So I says, \"Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it \\'cause I don\\'t know where it is you baloney...\" You make me wanna retch... How can I get her to notice me? Meet me at the treehouse, Bart. And come alone. Thanks for coming. I please to aim. I\\'m so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend. You won\\'t be needing this. A boyfriend... I really think you\\'d like him, Bart. His name\\'s Jimbo. Jimbo Jones? Uh, you\\'ve been flushing for twenty minutes. Is there a problem? Uh no, Principal Skinner. Very well, I\\'ll continue to wait. How can you like that guy? I don\\'t know. Maybe \\'cause he\\'s an outlaw. You know that dead body they found behind the mayor\\'s house? Jimbo killed him? No, but he poked him with a stick. Hey Laura, Dr. Tongue has arrived. That\\'s him, Bart. Who\\'s the dork? Leave him alone, he\\'s just a kid. I\\'ll show them who\\'s just a kid. Bart, it\\'s your bedtime. I laid out your jammy-jams. I married her! Homer, please I just had eggs. Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad. Thanks, that means a lot to me. All right you guys, I want you in bed before Jimbo gets here. What do you like about him? He\\'s just a good-lookin\\' rebel who plays by his own rules. It was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man. Hey! So I says to me bosuns, batten down the mizzen mast, maties... Captain McCallister, isn\\'t it a fact that you\\'re not a real Captain? Aye. Your honor I would like to show the court just how much shrimp Mr. Simpson ate. Bring it in boys! eighteen thousand letters all addressed to \"Santa Claus!\" You want the People of Springfield vs. Kris Kringle -- that\\'s next door. Oh Mrs. Simpson, isn\\'t it true your husband once consumed a ten pound bag of flour when no other food was available? Yes, but it was... Your witness. Uh, there\\'s a pizza here for... Right here. Mrs. Simpson, what did you and your husband do after you were ejected from the restaurant? We pretty much went straight home. Mrs. Simpson, you\\'re under oath. We drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another \"All You Can Eat\" fish restaurant. And when you couldn\\'t find one? We went fishing. Do these sound like the actions of a man who had... \"all he could eat?\" That could\\'ve been me! I\\'ve a proposition for ye, fair and true. Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face. What\\'s wrong? Come see \"Bottomless Pete\", nature\\'s cruelest mistake. Come for the freak -- stay for the food. Hey, baby, my shirt\\'s chafin\\' me. Mind if I take it off? Well... Okay. I\\'ve gotta do something. Hmmmm. But it says \"good for one free beer at Moe\\'s.\" This is Moe\\'s Tavern, isn\\'t it? No, this is... Bo\\'s Cavern. Give me my beer. Stupid Welcome Mobile, I knew it would ruin me. Hey, just a sec, I\\'ll check. Amanda Huggenkiss! Hey, I\\'m looking for Amanda Huggenkiss! Why can\\'t I find Amanda Huggenkiss! Maybe your standards are too high. You little S.O.B., if I ever find out who you are I\\'m gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt! My name is Jimbo Jones and I live at 1094 Evergreen Terrace. Ah-ha, big mistake pal! I knew he\\'d slip up sooner or later. Ah, yes. Rusty and dull. Barney, don\\'t steal any beer while I\\'m gone. What kind of pathetic drunk do you take me for? Somebody spilled beer in this ashtray. Let\\'s see, where is that map? Evergreen Terrace! There it is, F5. I don\\'t believe it. Now my pants are chafin\\' me. All right, who\\'s Jimbo Jones? I am. You just made your second mistake, buddy boy! Please, dude, don\\'t hurt me. Oh man... . That\\'s your outlaw? I wasn\\'t really gonna kill ya\\'. I was just gonna cut ya! Aah, forget it. Ouch, I better go check on Barney. Hey, Homer, phone call. Uh-oh. My heart just stopped. Ah, there it goes. Ow! Stupid wishing well. Jimbo, I don\\'t think we should see each other any more. You\\'re just not the guy I thought you were. Can I have my shirt back? Well, Bart, you were right about him. As usual. A knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way. You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teenage mustache, I\\'d go out with you in a second. Wow... Ivana Tinkle. Just a sec. Ivana Tinkle. Ivana Tinkle. All right, everybody put down your glasses. Ivana Tinkle. Har, har, har. Live from Hawaii\\'s beautiful Molokai Island: \"We\\'re not just for lepers anymore!\" It\\'s Carnival of the Stars! I\\'m your host, Troy McClure! You may remember me from such films as \"The Erotic Adventures of Hercules\" and \"Dial \\'M\\' For Murderousness.\" Tonight, we\\'ll see Angela Lansbury walk on hot coals! Excitement, She Wrote! How someone someone abuse their body that way? Moe! Don\\'t throw out that brine! But first -- a man whose inspiring battle with Percodan addiction is soon to be a movie of the week -- Krusty the Klown! I\\'ll be played by Jimmy Smits! Now he faces his toughest audience -- three Siberian tigers! Simba! On the ball! Not the face! Eh, they\\'ll be chewin\\' on him for a while. Ai yi yi -- La Policia! Hi, Homie. It\\'s really starting to snow. I think you should come home. But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban. Ow! Sorry, Ricardo. Take it easy, folks... it\\'s \"snow\" picnic out there. I \"snow\" what you mean. You\\'re dead weight, Marty. Ohh. Well, I got him as good as he got me. Now, before I give you the check, one more question: Uh, this place \"Moe\\'s\" you left just before the accident: this is a business of some kind? It\\'s a pornography store. I was buying pornography. \\'Fraid old Zeke, he rides up here with me. Can\\'t trust a pig with watermelons, ya know. She\\'ll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene. What country is this car from? It no longer exists. But take her for a test drive and you\\'ll agree, \"Dazgreb ebn zloty gdev!\". Put it in H! Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free. Do you come with the car? Oh, you! Do you come with the car? Oh, you! Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect. Our tireless safety engineers crash- test over one thousand cars a year. Hey, wait... that\\'s not a dummy! This exhibit is closed. The Batmobile! Adam West! Hey kids, Batman! Dad, that\\'s not the real Batman. Of course I\\'m Batman! See? Here\\'s a picture of me with Robin. Who the hell is Robin? Oh. I guess you\\'re only familiar with the new \"Batman\" movies. Michelle Pfeiffer... ha! The only true \"Catwoman\" is Julie Newmar, Lee Merriwether or Eartha Kitt. And I didn\\'t need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure West. And how come Batman doesn\\'t dance anymore? Remember the Batusi? Nice meetin\\' ya! Just keep moving. Don\\'t make eye contact. Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow. Homer, I\\'ve got to sneak these viable artworks out of the White House. But I can\\'t get out of my driveway because of those protesters. Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality. Eh, I can\\'t afford it. Pally, this doesn\\'t cost money, it makes money! You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side. Well... I really should discuss this with my wife. Your wife? What? You think I\\'m going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise? I\\'ll take it! I can\\'t believe you bought that plow. We can\\'t afford it. If you\\'re gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I\\'ll just have to stop doing stupid things. Good. Fine. I\\'ll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night! Oh, Homie, didn\\'t that hurt? No. Marge didn\\'t reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket. Forget it, Homer! People don\\'t read these things. Watch. Twenty percent off at Lullabuys. Just tell \\'em \"Big Baby\" sent you. I know you can hear me! I\\'m talkin\\' to you! You sicken me. I guess guys like us just can\\'t get a break. Well, at least I can\\'t sink any lower. Come back, diaper! Come back! Hi, ma. And now, to read from the Epistles of St. Paul, Homer Simpson. Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226. Homer, this is really low. Not as low as my low, low prices. Uh, huh, that\\'s Mr. Plow. I\\'m gonna lose my plow. Dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? Check it out. Arr! Ninety sea chanteys on three compact discs. BLOW THE MAN DOWN MATIES / BLOW THE MAN DOWN... ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT / IN THE NAVY COME ON AND JOIN YOUR FELLOW MAN... Act now and get a bonus CD: \"Hornpipe Fever.\" Arrgh. Hmmm. Almost time for our commercial. Dad, who\\'s watching TV at 3:17 a.m.? Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners... Look! There we are! It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV! Our driveway\\'s snowed in! Old Man Winter! That\\'s right! I fill your driveways with ice and snow! What are you gonna do about it? Nuthin\\', that\\'s what. Stop! Mr. Plow! Get out of here, you lousy... season! All right... I\\'m goin\\'... My head hurts. I have to lie down for a while. Hello, I\\'m Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow? Uh-huh. Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt. He could still surprise ya! But I\\'m a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system? Absolutely! My prices are so low, you\\'ll think I\\'ve suffered brain damage. You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren\\'t you Mr. Plow? Shut up, boy. So remember... CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT\\'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW! Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game. The waiting game sucks. Let\\'s play \"Hungry, Hungry Hippos.\" Thank you, Mr. Plow. Now my store can remain open. Let\\'s do it. We\\'re not prisoners anymore! We\\'re free! We can go anywhere we want. I\\'m cold and frightened. Well, I\\'m afraid classes may be canceled today. Look! We won\\'t miss a minute of school, thanks to your father. Say your prayers, Plow Boy! Mr. Plow, for making it possible for people to get where they\\'re going without resorting to public transportation or car pooling, I give you the key to the city. Here you go, Mr. Plow. A beer on the house. Wow, Moe, you didn\\'t even give a beer to those freed Iranian hostages. I don\\'t know. The SAT\\'s are tomorrow. Ah, they shouldn\\'t have been there in the first place. But Homer is a real hero. I wish I was a hero. Well wishing won\\'t make it so. You\\'ve got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be. Here I come world! How do you think he\\'ll do, Moe? I think he\\'ll do just fine. I was wrong about you buying that truck. I\\'m very proud of you, Mr. Plow. . This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind... Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth? No. No. Could you wear the Mr. Plow jacket. Just uh... for fun. Oooh. Heh heh heh. CALL MR. PLOW / THAT\\'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Ah, white gold. What the... What happ... uh... oh no... Hi ya, Homer! Say hello to the Plow King! Barney, you stole my idea! Don\\'t worry Homer. There\\'s nothing wrong with a little healthy competition. Well, well, if it isn\\'t Mr. Plow. Hey, Plow King, save some for me. Wow! Linda Ronstadt! Linda Ronstadt? How\\'d you get her? Eh, we\\'ve been lookin\\' for a project to do together for a while. SO YOU BETTER MAKE THAT CALL TO THE PLOW KING. How could you, Barney? After all I\\'ve done for you. Lachrymose is to dyspeptic as ebullient is to... effervescent! All right! Harvard here I come! All right. Just one -- if it\\'ll get you off my back. Hey, where have been all my life? Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding. Flanders, I thought I was your plow man. Ah, Homer, why don\\'t you plow it again? Forget it pal. I don\\'t need your phoney baloney job. I\\'ll take your money but I\\'m not gonna plow your driveway. Mr. West! You said there was a job for me! There was, when I called you, forty-five minutes ago. So long Superman. Your secret identity is safe with me. Ring, damn you. Ring! Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow. Hello, I\\'m calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors -- Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from \"Leave It To Beaver\"? Yeah, they were gay. Oh, what am I gonna do? I think you should do a new ad. One that\\'s fresh and original. I know! I\\'ll do a rap. I\\'M MR. PLOW AND I\\'M HERE TO SAY: I\\'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE. Ooh / Meow / Dad, stop you\\'re embarrassing us / Stop please. Stop it right now. Promise you\\'ll never do that again. All right. Mr. Simpson, I guarantee you we\\'ll come up with a commercial that can save your business. You know those radio ads where two people with annoying voices yammer back and forth? I invented those. / Yeow! Happens all the time. Dad, was that your commercial? I don\\'t know. The torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh, snow plow people... Come on, give me the key. These look like teeth marks. I thought there was chocolate inside. Well, why was it wrapped in foil? It was never wrapped in foil! Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield\\'s forbidding Widow\\'s Peak. Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene. Everything\\'s snowed in. All I can see is white! Arnie please... the ski conditions! Mayday! Mayday! I think I\\'m flying into a mountain! Tell my wife I love-- That\\'s great Arnie. Hmm... Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow\\'s Peak. I don\\'t know. I\\'d be up there all day... I wouldn\\'t be able to plow any other driveways... There\\'s a $10,000 bill in it for you. Oh yeah? Which president\\'s on it? Uh... all of them. They\\'re having a party. Jimmy Carter\\'s passed out on the couch. Wow! I\\'ll be right there. Barney, I\\'d like to put a Spanish version of your jingle on my next album. SEÃ‘OR PLOW NO ES MACHO / ES SOLAMENTE UN BORRACHO... Yeah, you do that. Well, I guess you can plow my driveway. But I wonder what happened to the Plow King. Well, I guess he just doesn\\'t respect his customers. Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt? Kiss my asphalt. So I says, \"Kiss my asphalt.\" Hmm? Hmm? Springfield\\'s beloved Plow King is trapped. Barney Gumble, shown here donating $50,000 to the Shelbyville Dance Theater... was caught in a sudden avalanche on Widow\\'s Peak earlier today. It was captured on film by a camera crew making the upcoming Fox special, \"In Search of Bigfoot.\" Hold it, Bob, we can see your wristwatch. Oh, dammit! Hey, what\\'s that? This is all my fault. I\\'ve gotta save him. Homie, please don\\'t go. Hey, this old girl\\'s as sure-footed as a mountain goat. Baaaaaaaaa! Baaaa! Baaaa... Baaa... Easy... easy... Ah, dying\\'s not so bad. I\\'ll be reunited with my loved ones. My dad... and that plant I never watered. Barney! Homer, you saved my life and I\\'m not gonna forget it. From now on, we\\'ll be partners. Barney, that\\'s great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them. Oh no? The snow\\'s melted! We can go outside again. I don\\'t like the looks of those teenagers. Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded greenhouse effect? Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter are the \"price\" of car pollution, you\\'ll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac. Y\\'ello. Hello, this is the Repo Depot. I\\'m just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow. Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I -- Chipwich for sale! Chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. Chipawich for sale! Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something. You mean... MR. PLOW, THAT\\'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin\\' it on. Maggie, can you say ba-ba? Can you say Ma-ma? Can you say \"get bent\"? Bart! Mr. Rogers says it all the time. He does not. Maggie, can you say \"daddy\"? Dad-dy? Kit-ty? \"Kit-ty\"? Be-bop? \"Be-bop\"? Shove it? \"Shove it?\" Did you hear that? She said \"burlap.\" Hmmm, I don\\'t think so. Oh, Maggie, when are you going to talk? Well, don\\'t push her. Remember, \"Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\" Takes one to know one! According to \\'Fretful Mother\\' magazine, if Maggie doesn\\'t talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender. Hey, what was my first word? Uh, well... Aye carumba! You know, I don\\'t think I remember... But the story of Lisa\\'s first word is very cute. Tell it, Mom. Tell, it Mom. Yeah, tell it, Mom. Well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women\\'s rights... a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh. Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East side of Springfield. Youse guys wanna play stickball? Soitenly. Yeah, sure. Over here. Did you girls watch the last episode of MASH? That Mike Farrell really boils my p\\'tata. I miss-a da Klinger already. WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT\\'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT... Homer! Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy. Homer. Daddy. Homer. Daddy. Da... da... da... Ye-esss... Domer. Why you little... He\\'ll tire himself out soon. Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after. Then what happened? Uh, They had 30 sons and 30 daughters. What were their names? Dennis... Brad... Mavis... Brad... No, this is true. The Coast Guard arrested Boy George for scraping the barnacles off his dinghy. Hi yo! Hi yo! Heh, heh. Got your nose. Got your wallet. Nooo! Bart, don\\'t you ever do that again. Understand? Beep. Guess what, Homie... There\\'s going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now. We\\'re gonna start doin\\' it in the morning? No. Oh. We\\'re going to have another baby. Marge that\\'s... Bye-bye, keys. Hear that, Bart? You\\'re going to have a little brother or sister to play with! Who did this? Baby. Bad baby! Heh, heh, heh. Uh-oh. I\\'m afraid we\\'re going to need a bigger place. No, we won\\'t. I\\'ve got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart\\'s crib and Bart can sleep with us until he\\'s 21! Won\\'t that warp him? My cousin Frank did it. You don\\'t have a cousin Frank. He became Francine back in \\'76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now. That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went househunting. Hey, Bart, want a dollar? Uh, uh, uh, you know what I want to hear. I\\'M A LITTLE TEAPOT, SHORT AND STOUT / THIS IS MY HANDLE/ THIS IS MY SPOUT... THE ITSY-BITSY SPIDER WENT UP THE WATER SPOUT, ETC... Oh yeah. DOWN CAME THE RAIN, AND WASHED THE SPIDER OUT. Love that spout medley. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, the only houses I have in your price range are in the neighborhood colorfully referred to as the \"Rat\\'s Nest.\" This one just came on the market. Oh dear. Now, here we have beautiful hardwood floors, track lighting... What\\'s that stench? Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat, you\\'ll wonder how you ever did without it. Mmmm. Hog fat. Let\\'s keep looking. Ew. Do you smell something? Arrr! Why buy a house when ye can buy a house boat? Excuse me. Don\\'t forget to check out the galley -- that\\'s real shag carpeting. Arrr. Once we get these cats out of the way it won\\'t be too bad. Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house. You\\'d be their tenants. I wish we lived in the kitty house. I could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. Go my pretties... kill, kill! We were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect... Just imagine what we can do with this place. Wow. How much? How much? Well, here\\'s what they\\'re asking. I can\\'t afford that! Dad, I have a problem. Why\\'d you come to me. I don\\'t know nothing. I used to get by on my looks. Now they\\'re gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit. Are you done? No, not yet. I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York. Dad, I don\\'t need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home. Oh! Well, all I own is this house, that I built with my own two hands. You didn\\'t build this house. You won it on a crooked \\'50\\'s game show! I ratted on everybody and got off scot free! All right, son. I\\'ll sell this dump and write you a check. Dad, first you gave me life, now you\\'ve given me a home for my family. I\\'d be honored if you came to live with us. Thank you. So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home? About three weeks. Mommy. Maggie I\\'ll give you this cookie if you talk. What? What? All right, you win round seven. When are we going to get to my first word? Your what-what? My first word. Eh, you don\\'t want to hear that story. I know! I\\'ll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes. Daaad! Wait a minute. That was a \"Lucy\" show... Okay, where were we? Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole. Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in... Hey, Homer. This house sucks. Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me \"Daddy.\" Homer. Nyahhh. WE WELCOME YOU TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD / SING FA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... Fa la la la la la la! FROM NOW ON, YOU\\'LL BE HISTORY... you\\'ll be hist... You\\'ll be hist... You\\'ll be history! Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle\\'s Flanders, but my friends call me Ned. Hi, Flanders. Who the Hell are you? My name\\'s Todd. Would you be my friend? You\\'re funny! If you need anything, just give a whistle. I could use a TV tray. Well, gee, I... Whaat? I just this minute bought it at the hardware st... You said, anything. Sure, you can borrow it for a little while. And that \"little while\" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh. Anyway, Bart had just entered the \"terrible twos.\" I AM SO GREAT / I AM SO GREAT / EVERYBODY LOVES ME / I AM SO GREAT... / EVERYBODY LOVES ME... Oh, honey... honey... honey... HONEY. Could you please be quiet? QUIET, BIET, DIET, ZIET, FIET... Bart, get out! Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day. Heyyy, kids! Summer\\'s just around the corner, and Krusty Burger is the official meat-flavored sandwich of the 1984 Olympics! Coochy, coochy, coo! Krusty funny. Duh. It\\'s all a part of our Krusty Burger Olympic Sweepstakes. Just scratch off the name of the Olympic event on your gamecard... and if America wins a gold medal, you win a free Krustyburger! Mmm... Mmm... Mmm! And... cut! Bleh! I almost swallowed some of the juice. Uhh. I\\'ll be tasting that for weeks. Great spot, K.C.! Put a sock in it, preppy. How much are these free burgers gonna cost me? Not to worry, Mr. K. We\\'ve rigged the cards. They\\'re all in events that Communists never lose. I like, I like. This just came over the wires, Big K. Uh huh... Soviet boycott... U.S. unopposed in most events... how does this affect our give-away? Let\\'s see...You personally stand to lose 44 million dollars. Bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib. Crib! Crib! I\\'m a baby! All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let\\'s go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib. Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you\\'re a genius. I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed. Now you can laugh yourself to sleep. If you should die before you wake... Can\\'t sleep... Clown\\'ll eat me... Can\\'t sleep... Clown\\'ll eat me... Oh, doctor! We are seconds away from the 100-meter Butterfly, and with the East German \"women\" shaving their backs 9,000 miles away. ... The Americans are heavy favorites. Patience, my pet. And the Americans jump out to an early lead. Although, we should point out that many of the other women represent countries that don\\'t have swimming pools. Boo hoo! You\\'re breaking my heart. Homie... I think the baby\\'s coming. Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life? Coming up next, an hour-long episode of Mama\\'s Family. Yes! We\\'ll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation. Shut up, Flanders. So, kids, what do you want to play? Good Samaritan! I get to clothe the leper. Lucky! Suppertime, boys. Oh boy! Liver! Iron helps us play! I want to go home. No I don\\'t. I GOT THE JOY, JOY, JOY, JOY, DOWN IN MY HEART -- Where? DOWN IN MY HEART TO STAY / AND IF THE DEVIL DOESN\\'T LIKE IT HE CAN SIT ON A TACK -- Ouch! Sit on a tack... Ouch! Paw! Can ye help me with my sums? Oh Bart, you met Grandma Flanders. Hope she didn\\'t scare ya. Hello, Joe! Can you say \"David Hasselhoff\"? Little Lisa. I\\'ve already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan. According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her. Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt. Bart, there\\'s someone in here who wants to meet you. Well, Bart, what do you think of little Lisa? I hate you. I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born. Mondale to Hart: Where\\'s the Beef? Where\\'s the beef? What the hell\\'s that supposed to mean? Where\\'s the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota. Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful baby... Here she is! Isn\\'t that cute -- she\\'s coughing. Aw. I\\'m gonna give her a kiss. I know a new song. You still here? Allouetty, jaunty allouetty, allouetty... ...Hmm. Allouetty... You already sang that part! The older they get, the cuter they ain\\'t. Hey, the baby just spit up! Oh, wooja, wooja, wooja wu. Uh, wooja, wooja, wooja, wooja, wu. Welcome back to the final day of this, the 23rd Olympiad. Brought to you by Krustyburger. You people are pigs! I personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger. I like those odds. In a moment, we\\'ll look at the courageous Korean gymnast Kim Hwan, who made a perfect dismount on what was later revealed to be a broken leg. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggg.... Ouch! But first, let\\'s go to the boxing venue. Please, please, please, please, please... Davah Hassahoff. Can you say \"Daddy\"? The American Drederick Tatum does a triumphant turkey trot over the supine Swede. One\\'s thoughts turn to Alexander of Macedon\\'s victory at Granicus and Issus. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!... Carl Lewis, I could kiss you. She has the reflexes of a young Mary Lou Retton. Have a wowwy-pop. Can I have a lolly-pop? Oh Bart, I\\'m afraid that was the last one. But I\\'ve got something even better for you -- a rubella inoculation. I wanna hold the baby. I wanna hold the baby. I\\'m sorry, Bart, you\\'re too little. Here, Bart, you can hold my beer. Homer! What? Goodnight, honey. Hello, Lisa. Lisa, time for your feed -- Who\\'s cuter now? She started it... came at me with a pipe... Stupid mailman... squeal on me... Heidy-ho, Simpson. Your son shoved this through our doggie door. And since we\\'re returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr... Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah. I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer. You wrecked everything. I\\'m leaving. Goodbye. Bart. What did you say? Bart! Sufferin\\' succotash! You can talk! Mom, Dad, she can talk! Say it again, Lis. Bart. Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart. I\\'m her first word! Well, I\\'m not surprised. Lisa\\'s crazy about you. She thinks you hung the moon. Wow! Lisa, can you say \"Mommy\"? No, sweetie. \"Daddy.\" Homer. I was sitting there! I don\\'t see your name on it. It\\'s right there. Bart! Don\\'t write on the rug! Ha, ha. Mom yelled at you. Did not. Did too. Y\\'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back. I hope you never say a word. Daddy. COPS: in Springfield! BAD COPS BAD COPS / BAD COPS BAD COPS / SPRINGFIELD COPS ARE ON THE TAKE / BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR THE MONEY WE MAKE / WHETHER IN A CAR OR ON A BUS / WE DON\\'T MIND USING EXCESSIVE FORCE BAD COPS BAD COPS / BAD COPS BAD COPS... All right, boys, time to bag us a cattle rustler. What in God\\'s name are you doing? Isn\\'t this 742 Evergreen Terrace? No, that\\'s next door. Close but no donut, cops. I can\\'t wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail. Honey, you really shouldn\\'t eat so much in bed. It\\'s not good for your heart. My heart is just fine... Homie, what is it? Just workin\\' the turkey through. There it goes! Hey Lis, there was a big train wreck last night. You wanna see the victims? Huh, okay. Bart, that\\'s gross! You\\'re right. Let\\'s bury them at sea. Daaad! You know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? I\\'ve got that right now. Ooh... bacon! Homer, I prepared a special surprise just for you. It could only be one thing. Psst! The best meat\\'s in the rump. Here you go. What the hell is this? Nice healthy oatmeal. Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat. Ugh, there\\'s a bug in it. No there isn\\'t. Trust me. Dad, there\\'s a bug on that. Eh. Come on, come on! Oh dear. Now, you\\'ve done it. I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise. It\\'s your heart. And I think it\\'s on its last thump. Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission. Hey, where\\'s he goin\\'? Billy, remember that old Plymouth we just couldn\\'t fix? We\\'re gonna sell him to Mr. Nickapaupolous? You\\'re a dull boy, Billy. Look at that pig stuffing his face with donuts on my time. That\\'s right, keep eating. Little do you know you\\'re drawing ever closer to the poisoned donut. There is a poisoned one isn\\'t there, Smithers? Uh, no sir. I discussed this with our lawyers. They consider it murder. Damn their oily hides. Bring him to me! Relax, Simpson. I just brought you in here for a friendly, \"Hello.\" ... and, \"Goodbye!\" You\\'re fired! Clear! But wait, perhaps I\\'m being too hasty. You are highly skilled... at goofing off! Now don\\'t worry, Homer. You\\'re the kind of guy I could really dig. A grave for. Your indolence is inefficacious! Huh? That means you\\'re terrible! Mr. Burns, I think he\\'s dead. Oh dear. Send a ham to his widow. Mmm... ham. No, wait. He\\'s alive. Oh good. Cancel the ham. Wow, look at that! How do they know to cross there? I\\'m telling you, it\\'s not going to work. See? He was taking a bite and his jaw locked. Hey, look. I can fit my entire fist in here. What\\'s that, Chief? Oooh, \"Buy three tubes of Mr. Blister, get one free.\" Hello?... Yes... Oh, dear lord! Homer\\'s in the hospital! They think it\\'s his heart. Oh, my God. What? Five cents off wax paper. Clear! More. Thank you. Oh, Homie, I was so frightened. Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes. Aw, little Homer. How\\'d he get that?! FALL ON YOUR KNEES / OH HEAR THE ANGELS\\' VOICES / What a voice. Young Homer is going to make me a millionaire. OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed. OH NIGHT, WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN... Dagnabit! Mr. Simpson, I\\'m afraid you\\'ve just had a mild heart attack. But I\\'m out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn\\'t kill me can only make me stronger. Oh no, quite the opposite. It\\'s made you weak as a kitten. Look! Hey, c\\'mon, quit it. Coochy coochy coo! Stop. Please stop. Oh, you swing like a girl. Come on, now. Please, have mercy. Got your nose. Not funny. How \\'bout this little bee? No! Remember your hippopotamus oath. Can\\'t you do something for him? Well, we can\\'t fix his heart, but we can tell you exactly how damaged it is. What an age we live in! Now, what you see here is the radioactive dye we injected, flowing through your husband\\'s circulatory system. But doctor, I haven\\'t injected the dye yet! Good lord. Hi. Now Homer, this is a new body fat analysis test. I start you jiggling, and measure how long it takes to stop. Woo hoo, look at that blubber fly. Yes. Nurse, cancel my one o\\'clock. Homer, I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to undergo a coronary by-pass operation. Say it in English, doc. You\\'re going to need open heart surgery! Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo. We\\'re going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker. Could you dumb it down a shade? Doctor, we\\'ll do whatever it takes to get my Homie well. Good. I must warn you though, the procedure will cost you upwards of thirty thousand dollars. I\\'m afraid it\\'s now forty thousand. Okay, okay. We need forty-thousand dollars. Now, how much do we have in the checkbook? Seventy dollars. Hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven\\'t cleared yet? No. Don\\'t you have health insurance at work? Well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge. Don\\'t worry, Marge. America\\'s healthcare system is second only to Japan... Canada, Sweden, Great Britain. Well, all of Europe. But you can thank your lucky stars we don\\'t live in Paraguay. Now before we give you health insurance, I have to ask you a few questions. Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away. Oh good. Now, under \"Heart Attacks\" you crossed out \"3\" and wrote \"0\". Oh, I thought that said, \"Brain Hemorrhages.\" Uh huh. And uh, do you drink? I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas. All right. Here\\'s your policy. Now let me tell you something, Mr. Sucker... I just... Oh, hold on there, you still have to sign it. Oh. I... Must... sign... policy... Sir, I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t insure you. I made an \"H\". No, that doesn\\'t count. Looks like an \"X.\" We\\'d better get you to a hospital. Can I have a free calendar? Okay. Oh doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt. Mr. Simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible. I can\\'t afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines. Oh yeah, that\\'s the stuff. Now, I know I haven\\'t been the best Christian. In fact, when you\\'re up there \"Blah, blah, blah-ing\" I\\'m usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars? Now, I know I haven\\'t been the best Jew... but I rented \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars? Now, I know I haven\\'t been the best... aw, forget it. Honey, did you have any luck? No, but the rabbi gave me this. What is it, Dad? Son, they call it a \"droodle\". Whoo hoo! Look at him go! Hi Everybody. Are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses? Bo-ring. Wait, this might be the answer we\\'re looking for. I will perform any operation for One twenty-nine ninety-five. Come in for brain surgery and receive a free Chinese finger trap. Okay, friend. You tried the best, now try the rest. Call 1-600-DOCTORB. The \"B\" is for bargain! Well, Marge, we could do worse. How? Uh... some dog could do the operation. Operation? What are you talking about? Kids, I have something to tell you. Oh, Homie, I don\\'t know. This might upset them. Nothing you say can upset us. We\\'re the MTV generation. We feel neither highs nor lows. Really? What\\'s it like? Eh. Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I\\'m not gonna sugarcoat it. So the tiny Aorta Fairies will take Mr. Leg Vein on a long trip to get married to Princess Left Ventricle. Dad, are you trying to tell us you\\'re getting a coronary-artery bypass graft? Uh, yeah. Oh, no. What if they botch it? I won\\'t have a dad... for a while. Kids. Kids... I\\'m not gonna die. That only happens to bad people. What about Abraham Lincoln? Uh... he sold poison milk to school children. Homer! Hey, I\\'m just trying to make it easier on \\'em. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Homer Simpson! Well, if that don\\'t put the \"dink\" in co-inky-dink. Flanders? What are you doin\\' here? I\\'m having a kidney and a lung removed. Who are you donating them to? First come, first served! What are you in for? I got a bad heart. If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would. Shut up, Flanders. Hi, everybody! I\\'m Dr. Nick Riviera Dr. Riviera... Dr. Nick Riviera please report to the coroner immediately. The coroner? I\\'m so sick of that guy. Well, see you in the operating place. Dr. Riviera! Dr. Riviera! Where are the bodies? Ah, such a nice day, I think I\\'ll go out the window. Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and \"Sweatin\\' to the Oldies,\" Volumes One, Two and Four. Ah, you know, Homer, that beer ain\\'t free. Dear Lord, I\\'m really scared about this operation tomorrow. If something happens, please look after Marge, and make sure my kids grow up right. Shhh. Sorry. ... And that\\'s why God causes train wrecks. My dad is very sick. What\\'s gonna happen if he dies? Well, if he\\'s been good, he\\'ll go to heaven. In heaven, you get to do whatever you like best, all the time. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down... Bed goes up. Bed goes down... Hey hey! Hey, what\\'s the matter? Oh, that\\'s right. My grotesque appearance. Krusty, why are you here? Oh, it\\'s part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump. Oh well, I could use a good laugh. Well, there\\'s nothing funny about what you\\'re about to go through. I know, I\\'m in the Zipper Club myself. You seem okay. Yeah? Well, I got news for ya. This ain\\'t make-up. They say the greatest tragedy is when a father outlives his son. I\\'ve never fully understood why that is. Frankly, I can see an up side to it. We passed this card around at work. Gee, thanks, guys. They had a hell of a time replacing you. When I first heard about the operation, I was against it. But then I thought, if Homer wants to be a woman, so be it. Barney, I\\'m not getting a sex change! Whaaa? Well, what the hell am I sposed to do with this jumbo thong bikini? Uh, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old time\\'s sake. Thanks, Moe. Mom, this is fascinating. Did you know that they\\'ll stop Dad\\'s heart for six whole minutes? I don\\'t know if I like you reading all those cardiology books. No, Mom, it\\'s very reassuring. And I\\'ve learned a great deal from this cow\\'s heart I got at the butcher shop. Insert the retractor and crank it until the ribs swing open like a rusty drawbridge. Oh no! Blood! Next, make an incision in the coronary artery... And we are back with more of \"People Who Look Like Things.\" Oh no! no! Someone taped over the end of this. All we ask is to be treated with dignity and respect. And a new candle now and then? And a new... no! Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants. Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you\\'re gonna be lonely... Oh Homie, I could never remarry... Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows. Ohhh... kids, you can come in now. Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let\\'s see... uh... Oh, I\\'m no good at this. Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won\\'t get to see you grow up, because... I know you\\'re gonna turn out great, with or without your old man. Thanks dad. And Lisa... I guess this is the time to tell you... You\\'re adopted and I don\\'t like you. Bart! But don\\'t worry, because you\\'ve got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you. Oh dad. Hi, everybody! Hi Dr. Nick! Now if something should go wrong, let\\'s not get the law involved. One hand washes the other -- Ooh, that reminds me. These gloves came free with my toilet brush. What the hell is that? Marge, this is Andre. Hello... I think you two would make a lovely couple. My husband is still alive! Oh, thank God. I hope he pulls through. Not me. Let\\'s have a minute of silent prayer for our good friend Homer Simpson. How long has it been? Six seconds. Do we have to start over? Hell, no. Poor Mister Homer. Could it be that my snack treats are responsible for his wretched health? Gimme some jerky. Would you like some vodka with that? Oh, what the Hell, sure. Doctor, what\\'s wrong? Don\\'t you know where to make the incision? Alright Nick, don\\'t panic. Think back to Med school. Seriously baby, I can prescribe anything I want. I know I\\'m supposed to cut something, but what? And where? Hey! The incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. Below! Thanks, little girl. THE KNEE BONE\\'S CONNECTED TO THE... SOMETHING. / THE SOMETHING\\'S CONNECTED TO THE... RED THING. / THE RED THING\\'S CONNECTED TO MY... WRISTWATCH... UH-OH. Good news! The operation was a complete success. Oh, that\\'s wonderful! Dr. Nick Riviera. Remember me? Well if it isn\\'t my old friend Mr. McGreg -- with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg. All right, Dad! You rule intensive care! Yabba dabba doo! SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE\\'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE\\'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE What do they do with these things after we seal \\'em? I hear they dump them in an abandoned chalk mine and cover \\'em with cement. I hear they\\'re sending \\'em to one of those southern states where the governor\\'s a crook. Either way I\\'m sleepin\\' good tonight! Well, sir, where shall we dump this batch -- the playground? No, all those bald children are arousing suspicion -- to the park! I think it\\'s full, sir. That\\'s ridiculous, the last tree held nine drums. Agent Malone, Environmental Protection Agency. Some Boy Scouts stumbled on your little game of \"hide the ooze.\" Mr. Burns, in light of your unbelievable contempt for human life, this court fines you three million dollars. Smithers, my wallet\\'s in my right front pocket. Oh, and uh, I\\'ll take that statue of Justice too. Sold! Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk. Ohh, there\\'s going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend Mr. Burns\\' money. Oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools. Children, it\\'s time for your history lesson. Put on your virtual reality helmets. Hm excellent. Hello, Lisa. I\\'m Genghis Khan. You\\'ll go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat. Hmm? C\\'mon, Lis. We both know how this money should, nay, must be spent. Bart, we\\'ll do anything you want. Just call off your giant mechanical ants! Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of. Like a giant billboard that says, \"No fat chicks\"? No. Oooh, it looks like everyone in Springfield showed up for this. Could this town be any stupider? Ordah! Please rise for the a Pledge of Allegiance. Get to the money! In a moment. First, let\\'s review the minutes from our last meeting... Get to the money! Very well. We will now hear suggestions for the-a disbursement of the-a two million dollars. Don\\'t you mean three million dollars? Of course. How silly of me. Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town. Bo-ring! Hello. My name is Mr. Snrub, and I come from... eh, someplace far away. Yes, that will do. Anyway, I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant. I like the way Snrub thinks. Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers. I have been shot eight times this year, and as a result I almost missed work. Crybaby. My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first... Chat away. I\\'ll just amuse myself with some pornographic playing cards. Well surely you\\'ve all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in. Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight. Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly! And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance. Now hold on just one minute. Sure, we could fix up Main Street. We could put all our eggs in one basket... Shut up! I wasn\\'t done yet. I\\'m just saying we could blow all our money on a stupid little street, but.. I ain\\'t fer it, I\\'m agin\\' it. Main Street! Main Street! Main Street! All those in favor of Grampa Simpsons\\' plan for re-building Main Street, please... You know, a town with money\\'s a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it! Heh-heh... mule. The name\\'s Lanley. Lyle Lanley. And I come before you good people tonight with an idea. Probably the greatest... Ah, it\\'s not for you. It\\'s more of a \"Shelbyville\" idea. Now wait just a minute. We\\'re twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville. Just tell us your idea and we\\'ll vote for it. All right. I tell you what I\\'ll do. I\\'ll show you my idea. I give you the Springfield Monorail! I\\'ve sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook and, by gum, it put them on the map! Well, sir, there\\'s nothing on earth like a genuine, bona-fide, electrified, six-car monorail. What\\'d I say? Monorail. What\\'s it called? Monorail! That\\'s right, monorail! I hear those things are awfully loud. It glides as softly as a cloud. Is there a chance the track could bend? Not on your life, my Hindu friend. What about us brain-dead slobs? You\\'ll be given cushy jobs. Were you sent here by the devil? No, good sir, I\\'m on the level. The ring came off my pudding can! Take my pen knife, my good man. I swear it\\'s Springfield\\'s only choice, throw up your hands and raise your voice. Monorail! What\\'s it called? Monorail! Once again! Monorail! But Main Street\\'s still all cracked and broken. Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken. MONORAIL / MONORAIL / MONORAIL! Mono... Monorail! Monorail! Monorail! I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street. Well, you should have written a song like that guy. Thank you for coming, Mr. Lanley. I\\'m Miss Hoover. Miss Hoover? That is hard to believe. Oh, you. Now, I\\'m here to answer any questions you children may have about the monorail. Can it outrun The Flash? You bet. Can Superman outrun The Flash? Eh, sure, why not? Hello, little girl, wondering if your dolly can ride the monorail for free? Hardly. I\\'d like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population. Ha, ha. Young lady, that\\'s the most intelligent question I\\'ve ever been asked. Really? Wow, Dad. You really know your monorails. Oh, I could give you an answer, but the only ones who\\'d understand it would be you and me... And that includes your teacher. Next question -- You there, eating the paste. Coming soon, it\\'s \"Truckosaurus, the Movie\" starring Marlon Brando as the voice of John Truckosaurus. You crazy car. I don\\'t know whether to eat you or kiss you. Celebrity voice impersonated. Are you stuck in a dead-end job? Maybe. Are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box? What\\'s it to ya? Are you on your third beer of the evening? Does whiskey count as beer? Well, maybe it\\'s time you joined the exciting field of Monorail Conducting by enrolling at the Lanley Institute. Actual institute may not match photo. Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor. Homer, no... It\\'s my life-long dream. Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember? Oh, yeah. Good evening. Before we begin, is anyone here an investigative reporter? I am, and.. she is. Well, I\\'d like you to please leave. Should we take our hidden camera? Would you? Let\\'s go, Phil. True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail? Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it\\'s true. No, you were right, it\\'s \"false.\" Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor! That\\'s right, boy. You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job. Heh-heh. Kids. But now, I want to follow in your footsteps. Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju! I\\'ll get back to you. Come on... keep it comin\\'... over... over... mmm hmm... mmm hmm... Hi, Homer! I hate that sound. According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong? \"What if?\" What if I\\'m taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I\\'d be killed! It frightens me that you want to work on something that\\'s so unsafe. We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on? No. What if I undo this button? Goodnight, Homer. What if I talk like this? What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken. ...so then, \"mono\" means \"one\" and \"rail\" means \"rail.\" And that concludes our intensive three-week course. Hey, wait, man. Who gets to be conductor? Oh, right, that. Well, I\\'ve been monitoring your progress closely... But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest. Who, me? Yeah, sure. Woo-hoo! After an exhaustive search, Springfield has found its monorail conductor -- Homer Simpson. And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake. THE WICKED WITCH. Homer, there\\'s a family of opossums in here! I call the big one Bitey. I\\'m going to see Mr. Lanley. Mr. Lanley? Mr. Lanley? How much did you see? Nothing incriminating. Good. Well, bye. I don\\'t know why I leave this lying around. I\\'ve sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook. Is there a chance the track could bend? I call the big one Bitey. I\\'ve sold momorails to Brockway, Odgenville and North Haverbrook. Is there a chance the track could bend. I call the big one Bitey. Go away! There ain\\'t no monorail and there never was! Excuse me, Miss, you asked about the monorail? Who are you? My name is Sebastian Kobb. Lanley hired me to build his monorail. He cut corners everywhere... bad wiring... faulty brakes... and the celebrity on the maiden voyage was Gallagher. This is all that\\'s left of one of the crappiest trains ever built. Mr. Kobb, what can we do? You just better have a damn good conductor. I locked my keys in there. Get a rock. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing brings out the stars like the maiden voyage of a monorail. Everyone\\'s here, from recently outed leading man, Dash Calhoun... to Krusty the Clown! Hey, Hey. Krusty, why won\\'t you answer my calls? You\\'ve never even seen our son! Homer. Here\\'s one of those loveable high-schoolers from TV\\'s Springfield Heights, 90210. He\\'s cool, he\\'s sexy, he\\'s thirty-four years old, let\\'s hear it for Kyle Darren! And here\\'s country singing sensation, Lurleen Lumpkin, fresh from her latest stay at the Betty Ford clinic! What ya been up to Lurleen? I spent last night in a ditch. How about that, folks? Now, I\\'d like to turn things over to our Grand Marshal, Mr. Leonard Nimoy. I\\'d say this vessel could do at least warp five. And let me say, \"May the force be with you.\" Do you even know who I am? I think I do. Weren\\'t you one of the Little Rascals? Mr. Lanley! Aren\\'t you gonna ride the monorail? Little lady, I\\'d love to. But I have to catch a plane. But the ride only takes a minute. Yeah, well my plane leaves in less than one minute. His car SCREECHES off. All aboard! We\\'re too late! I shouldn\\'t have stopped for that haircut. Sorry. Actually, you see the doors on Star Trek were not mechanical. We had a stagehand on either side who would pull the door open when he saw you approach. Uh-huh. Stick your head out the window, boy. It\\'s the greatest! Yee-hawww! Can\\'t you stop it, Dad? I\\'m trying my best. The lever you have pulled -- brakes -- is not in service. Please make a note of it. How fast are they going? Well, judging by your husband\\'s cowardly scream, 180 miles an hour. Ahhh. It\\'s making me dizzy. I\\'m gonna take a nap. All right, I\\'m in charge here. Ah, run along, Quimby. I think they\\'re dedicating a phone booth somewhere. Watch it, you talking tub of donut batter. Hey, I got pictures of you, Quimby! You don\\'t scare me. That could be anyone\\'s ass. Now, beat it. I\\'m calling the shots. I think that sash is cutting off the air to your brain. The town charter says in an emergency, I run the show. Well, we\\'ll just see about that. Let\\'s go to town hall. Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you? Hey, according to the charter, as Chief Constable I\\'m supposed to get a pig every month \"... and two comely lasses of virtue true.\" Keep the pig. How many broads do I get? Hey. Hey, hey, let go! You\\'re rippin\\' it. No, you are. No, you are. Let go, that\\'s the charter. Wait a minute, we can just shut off the power! No such luck, it\\'s solar powered. Solar power. When will people learn? A solar eclipse. The cosmic ballet goes on. Does anyone wanna switch seats? I did it! Folks, this is your captain speaking. Our nonstop flight to Tahiti will be making a brief layover in North Haverbrook. North Haverbrook? Where have I heard that name before? Oh, no. Oh, no! There he is! Seat 3-F. Krusty wants out! No. The world needs laughter. Are we gonna die, son? Yeah, but at least we\\'ll take a lot of innocent people with us. Homer? Homer? Y\\'ello. Homer, there\\'s a man here who thinks he can help you. Batman? No, he\\'s a scientist. Batman\\'s a scientist. It\\'s not Batman! I think I have a way to stop the train. You need to find an anchor of some sort. Think harder, Homer. I\\'ll take that. Uh... Dad? Now separating Siamese Twins is a long and costly procedure. Arr. Ye call that an anchor? Donuts. Is there anything they can\\'t do? Dad, you\\'re a hero! Yes, son. I\\'m the best mono-thingy guy there ever was. Well, my work is done here. Whadaya mean, your work is done? You didn\\'t do anything. Didn\\'t I? And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the Popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere. Hey, hey! Hey Lance Murdock! You just jumped 16 blazing school buses. What are you going to do now? I\\'m going to Duff Gardens. Duff Gardens! Home of \"The Whiplash.\" To be completed in 1994. And \"The Washing Machine\"! Wowww. See the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous Beerquarium! Bart, warm up the car. We\\'re going to Duff Gardens. Yayyy! Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth? We\\'re under six! And I\\'m a college student! Heh, heh. Kids, I have some bad news. Your Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on. Gladys, Gladys... `bout yay high, blue hair, big dent in her forehead? No honey, Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty. Oh yeah, there she is. The funeral\\'s in Little Neck Falls. Looks like we\\'ll have to go to Duff Gardens another time. We understand. No use complaining about something you can\\'t change. But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now! Oh Homer, quit pouting. I\\'m not pouting. I\\'m... mourning. Stupid dead woman. ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI... ALL COVERED WITH CHEESE... I LOST MY POOR MEATBALL... If you don\\'t mind! We\\'re on our way to a funeral. Ding-dong, the witch is dead. WHICH OLD WITCH? Patty. Selma. I\\'m sorry. He\\'s hugging us. What do we do? Just close your eyes and think of MacGyver. Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me. Hey you don\\'t hear Lisa complaining. I can\\'t believe Auntie Gladys is really gone. Her legend will live forever. Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman! Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that\\'s good. Homer, that\\'s very rude of you. What? Could we please stop somewhere? My butt\\'s asleep. All right, I\\'m almost there. Another placemat, sir? Please. While we\\'re waiting for our pie, let\\'s take a minute to remember Great Aunt Gladys. Wait a minute. That was \"Prince of Tides.\" Five... six... seven... eight... What are you kids playing? Counting game. That\\'s nice. ... Nine... ten... He was a good man. He was a kind man. He gave to his community and asked little in return. He never... That\\'s a woman? Dear Lord. Well, I guess most of what I said can be salvaged. Take a seat, bozo. And that \"eulogy\" better not show up on the bill. I\\'ll keep this short. Gladys lived alone. Died alone. I guess you could say she was a role model for Selma and me. She wasn\\'t a rich woman... but she was rich in spirit. Forgot my hat. Patty, I want a baby. Don\\'t hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers. Eh. It\\'s just not fair, dammit! Goodbye, Great Aunt Gladys. I wish I had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years. Don\\'t worry about it. I\\'m Lionel Hutz, executor of Ms. Bouvier\\'s estate. She left a video will, so I earn my fee simply by pressing this \"Play\" button. Pretty sweet, eh? I would like to start by reading a passage from Robert Frost. \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and... Homer! All in favor of skipping the poem? Thank you. And that has made all the difference... Now, let\\'s get down to business. To my executor, Lionel Hutz, I leave fifty thousand dollars. Mr. Hutz! You\\'d be surprised how often that works. You really would! To Marge, I leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities. They\\'re all here. Otto Von Bismarck. Maurice Chevalier. Right up to Jay Leno. These chips were my children, Marjorie. Take special care of them. Uh, oh. To my sister Jackie, I leave my pet iguana, Jubjub. Why didn\\'t she just leave me the bowel obstruction that killed her? To my dear, childless nieces, Patty and Selma, I leave my grandfather clock and these words: Don\\'t die lonely, like me. Raise a family. And do it now. Now. Now! Now! NOW! Hey, a grandfather clock, not bad. Aunt Gladys was right. There\\'s something missing in our lives. Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll get that Barking Dog record tomorrow. What do I do here? Just tell us about yourself. Well, I want to have a baby before it\\'s too late You\\'re looking at a free lunch, boys. Come and get it. Ach! Back to the Loch with ye, Nessie! One drop of this love potion and you will have any man you desire. Really? What are the magical ingredients? Mostly corn syrup, a little rubbing alcohol... you\\'ll be lucky if it doesn\\'t make your hair fall out, actually. Paper or plastic? You decide. So, wearing a belt, are ya? Yep. No suspenders for you. I guess not. Orange is really your color. They make us wear this. Shall we continue this conversation over dinner? Uh... I\\'m not allowed to date customers... it\\'s store policy. No it isn\\'t. Ow. Shut up, Arnold. No, go for it, man. R... F... J... question mark... smiley face... Next! Wait a minute. It says here you\\'re single. Did I do wrong? Combed... biscuits... chicken... yellow... mailman... You\\'re reading the wine list, sir. Very good. I don\\'t know how to thank you for dinner. Use your imagination. Ehh! Get out of my car. This isn\\'t my house. Come to Duff Gardens, where roaming gangs aren\\'t a big problem anymore. Now featuring the clean-shaven sounds of \"Hooray for Everything!\" HEY KIDS / TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE / AND ALL THE RACES SING: / DOO DOO DOO / SHOO-BEE DOOBEE DOO...DO DO DO... SHOO-BEE DOOBEE DOO... YEAH! Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend? Sure... unless another aunt dies. Selma! Your date\\'s over already? Yeah. I was so depressed I ate a jar of expired olives. I guess I\\'ll never have a baby. Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination? Boy, I don\\'t know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot. I knew that. How do I know I\\'m getting quality? Don\\'t worry. Our donors have to pass a rigorous screening process. All done! Thank you. Always a pleasure. What a beautiful little girl. A hundred and one frozen pops. A Nobel Prize winner... an NBA All-Star... Ooh, one of the \"Sweathogs!\" I checked, it\\'s not Horshack. Oh. Are you sure you wanna have a baby this way? Yeah, you\\'ve had some pretty bad experiences ordering out of catalogs. Remember that mail order husband? Ooh! You look just like your picture. Sorry. My mind\\'s made up. I wanna have a kid and this is the only way I can do it. Why do you wanna have a baby so bad? I gotta lot of love to give. And right now my only outlet is my ham radio. Modgreb ebn ljuobvitcher! Are you sure you\\'ve thought this through? A child can really change your life. You\\'ll have to give up smoking. I\\'ll chew. No man\\'ll want you. All I got now is sperm in a cup. Oh great. Dad\\'s dead. Have you been eating that sandwich again? Sand... wich... Geez, we hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie. I\\'ll give it a good home. You\\'ve been eating that thing for a week. I think the mayonnaise is starting to turn. Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge. Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you should throw it away. Suggestion noted. Marge, I\\'d like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment. Are you going to eat it? Yes. You look terrible. I don\\'t care. I\\'m going to Duff Gardens. S-s-o cold. Your lips are turning blue. I think you\\'d better stay home. No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah! ... We really appreciate your taking the children on such short notice. We\\'ll have fun, won\\'t we kids? To get to Duff Gardens, I\\'d ride with Satan himself. That\\'s the spirit! See ya tonight. Goodbye Dad! Don\\'t eat any solids. But I love solids. It won\\'t be any fun without you, Dad. Yayyy! This is all your fault! Oh, how can I stay mad at you? There it is! The Duff Beeramid. The Beeramid contains so much aluminum it would take five men to lift it. Twenty-two immigrant laborers died during its construction... Ah, plenty more where that came from. Look! It\\'s the Seven Duffs! There\\'s \"Tipsy\"! And there\\'s \"Queasy\"! There\\'s \"Surly\"... and \"Remorseful\". Hey! Take a picture. It\\'ll last longer. Get outta here. Four score and seven years ago, we took the finest hops and barley to brew a refreshing, full-bodied lager. Ahhh. BOOM-CHA-CHA-BOOM. I\\'M RAPPIN\\' ABIE AND I\\'M HERE TO SAY / IF YOU WANNA DRINK BEER DUFF\\'S THE ONLY WAY. I SAID THE ONLY WAY... BREAKDOWN! This is a disgrace. Settle down. Anything this bad has to be educational. Bart! Let\\'s see if they wore underwear back then. Yeah! Do you feel any better? No. What are the odds of getting sick on a Saturday? A thousand to one. Well, to cheer you up I rented a couple of videos. \"Boxing\\'s Greatest Weigh-Ins\" and \"Yentl\". Yentl? Whuzzat? It deals with a bookish young woman\\'s efforts to enter Rabbinical school. Sounds great! Oh my God, you\\'re delirious. Beer Goggles - See the World Through the Eyes of a Drunk. Wow! You\\'re charming the pants off of me. What\\'d you say, Aunt Selma? I said take off those damn glasses! Oooh, this looks like fun... A bench! Kids, what do you say you go get your Aunt Selma a beer smoothie? Hey man, if the line\\'s this long, it\\'s gotta be good. Get bent. What\\'s going on here? Oh, Yentl. I might have known. That Yentl puts the \"she\" in Yeshiva. Hmmm, well, you\\'ve cooled down. That\\'s what you think . You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better. The Erotic Adventures of Hercules. With Norman Fell as Zeus! Woo hoo! DUFF BEER FOR ME/ DUFF BEER FOR YOU/ I\\'LL HAVE A DUFF/ YOU HAVE ONE TOO/ DUFF BEER FOR ME/ DUFF BEER FOR YOU/ I\\'LL HAVE A DUFF/ YOU HAVE ONE TOO/ I want to get off. You can\\'t get off. We have five more continents to visit. Hey Lis. I dare you to drink the water. I\\'m not sure that is water. Chicken? Bart, quit it, Bart. Quit it, quit it, quit it! Bart, be quiet. Lisa, drink the water. They\\'re all around me. No way out. No way out I tell you! What\\'s wrong? Well, you just put your head right here. Aaaahhhh!!! Hercules, the cyclops tore off my clothes. Bart! Lisa! Lisa!! Ahhh, I can see the music. Mitch, you\\'re doing a bang-up job. Thank you, sir. Whoa. That isn\\'t good. STOP THE RIDE!!! I\\'ll have to ask my supervisor. Better stop it. Can\\'t you do something? Surly only looks out for one guy. Surly. Sorry, Surly. Shut up. Don\\'t blame these kids. It\\'s not their fault. I think their father is missing a chromosome. Ms. Bouvier, while we were rescuing this boy, hoodlums made off with three bumper cars. And I don\\'t think George Washington will never be the same. Ai yi, yi, yi, yi... We found this one swimming naked in the Fermentarium. I am the Lizard Queen! Give her this... and this... and then these. Thank you, Doctor. Oh, I\\'m not a doctor. Come to Homercles. I can\\'t. The beans\\'ll burn. Homercles cares not for beans. Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens? Can\\'t talk. Comin\\' down. How do you do it, Homer? You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this... No, I mean raising kids. I just couldn\\'t cut it today. All I wanted was a little version of me that I could hold in my arms... Oh, Jubjub. When I went to pick him up, Mom was trying to stab him with a hat pin. Shh! Nineteen. You make me feel. You make me feel like a natural woman... Eye of the Tiger, Bart. Eye of the-- I stopped it! And I hurt somebody. Haw, haw. Boys, it wasn\\'t easy choosing only one of you for the free week at Pele\\'s Soccer and Acting Camp. Let\\'s all congratulate... Nelson!!! Thanks, Dad! Told ya! Come on, Bart! We\\'re gonna go sneak into an R-rated movie. It\\'s called \"Barton Fink!\" No thanks, I told my Dad I\\'d wait for him. Bar-ton Fink! Bar-ton Fink! Barton Fink! Homer, we\\'re going to my sisters\\'! Remember, pick up Bart! I\\'m on my way! What\\'d ya say, Marge? That could be Dad... station wagon... luggage rack... I AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR / IN NUMBERS TOO BIG TO IGNORE / AND I KNOW TOO MUCH TO GO BACK TO TODAY Dad, where are you? Tonight, on \"Wings...\" Aah, who cares? This isn\\'t funny. Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart! Trab pu kcip. Trab pu kcip. What have we told you about writing on the walls? Go to your room. After sixteen glorious seasons, the Green Bay faithful bid farewell to Bryan Bartlett Starr. Hmm, I keep thinking I\\'m forgetting something. Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart Bart! Bart Bart Bart! Bart! I can\\'t think with all this noise! What am I supposed to do? Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar? Bart?... Bart! Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?... Bart! Dad, hide your shame! Hey Homie, I can see your doodle! Shut up, Flanders. Hey, boy. How was soccer practice? Hey, Bart, son. Here\\'s my way of saying, \"I\\'m sorry.\" I know you\\'re mad at me right now, and I\\'m kinda mad too... I mean, we could sit here and try to figure out \"who forgot to pick up who\" till the cows come home. But let\\'s just say we\\'re both wrong and that\\'ll be that. Now how about a hug? Hello, New York! When Lorne asked me to host this show, I said Lorne, why me? I mean, I did just star in my first movie with Marvin Hagler and Tovah Borgnine. Yeah! Anyway. We got a great show for you. Well actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. Uh... we\\'ll be right back. I miss Joe Piscopo. Lost your dad? Uh-huh. He\\'s not coming back, is he? He might. No, he\\'s not. But at Bigger Brothers we can help. Hello, Bigger Brothers? My name is Bart Simpson and I don\\'t have a father. And now, it\\'s time for another episode of the Big Ear Family! Honey, I\\'m home! Ooh, I got wax in my ears. Better clean `em. Eh? Eh? This goes on for 12 more minutes. So the last time you saw your father was six years ago. Yeah... he left me out on the curb for the ashman. What a revoltin\\' development. You brave little soldier. I\\'ve been saving someone special for a case like yours. Bart Simpson? Yo! I\\'m Tom. Let\\'s ride. Bart\\'s dad has really pulled himself together. Bart\\'s not mad at me. He called you a bad father. Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one\\'s butt. Permit me to demonstrate. No, I just think you should talk to Bart about-- Good Lord! Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill? It\\'s that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It\\'s not fair, it\\'s not fair I tells ya. No, no. Someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called \"The Corey hotline.\" Wasn\\'t me. Lisa. Why didn\\'t you ask our permission, Lisa? I did. Dad, can I... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw honey, I know what you\\'re going through. When I was a girl I had a crush on Bobby Sherman. The point is, I want you to stop making these calls. All right, Mom. I promise you will never be billed for another call. Bobby Sherman... Your dad ever take you to baseball games? Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand. Hit me. Twenty. Hit me. Twenty-one. Hit me. Twenty-two. If I ever meet your dad . The start of the game will be delayed so we can introduce the recruiter for the Springfield Communist Party. BOO! Eh, this is better than dart day. Now let those ear drops sit for 20 minutes. If you get bored, here\\'s a M*A*S*H coloring book. Here\\'s a good one. \"Hawkeye\\'s antics irritate the other surgeons.\" Hi, you\\'ve reached the Corey hotline. $4.95 a minute. Here are some words that rhyme with Corey: Glory. Story. Allegory. Montessori... Okay, Bart. Tomorrow we\\'ll blast your quads. This meatball soup is delicious, Stimpy. That\\'s not meatball soup. That\\'s my collection of furballs in stomach acid. You idiot!! You\\'re trying to kill me, man. Someday I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero, Tom. He lent me this new weapon called a Neural Disrupter. He\\'s not dead, is he Bart? Nah... But I wouldn\\'t give him any homework for a while. Very good, Bart. Thank you. Oh, don\\'t thank me. Thank an unprece-dented eight-year military build-up. Hm. Milhouse, you\\'re next. Uhhh... I have a horsie. Wuss! Lisa, I\\'m glad you came. I know you young-uns think we old timers aren\\'t any fun. But we\\'ll show \\'em. We\\'ll show `em all! Heh, heh, heh, heh. Hi, this is Corey. I hope you and I can get married some day. Hey, boy! Where you going? Father-son picnic. Have a good time! Wait a minute. Lisa, I know I can trust you to inventory this Glee Club peanut brittle. Yes, Principal Skinner. Now, I\\'ve gotta slash 40 percent out of the budget. Science... Ah, music and art. What in blazes?! Good Lord... That\\'s a 900 number! Let\\'s see what\\'s in the newspaper today... Hmmm... \"Canada Stalls On Trade Pact\"... Hey, look at that forest fire down there. Yeah. Great. What\\'s the matter? Well... I\\'ve been thinking. You\\'ve been really great to me... but there\\'s probably some other kid who needs you even more. Bart, I could kiss you, if the Bigger Brothers hadn\\'t made me sign a form promising I wouldn\\'t. No one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. Now, let\\'s set down at that Frogurt stand. So that\\'s it! Hello, son. Where have you been? Playing with Milhouse. No, you haven\\'t! You\\'ve been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven\\'t you, haven\\'t you. Look at me. Dad, it just kinda happened. You\\'re taking this too hard. How would you like me to take it? \"Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I\\'ll be waiting for you?\" I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do it. Well, what are you going to do? Ho, ho, you\\'ll see. And what are your reasons for wanting a little brother? Uh... Revenge. What the? Welcome aboard, Mr. Simpson! Any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you. Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!... Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake. Do you have a bigger brother for me yet? Okay. I\\'ll be back in an hour. I\\'ll take him! Do you have him in blonde? Lisa, the only way you\\'ll lick this is one day at a time. If you can make it till midnight without calling the Corey line, you\\'ll know you\\'ve beaten it forever. Midnight? Listen to your mother, Lisa. I owe everything I have to my mother\\'s watchful eye... and swift hand. Oh, there\\'s mother now. Watching me. What\\'s that, mother? They have a right to be here. It\\'s school business. I... Mother, that sailor suit doesn\\'t fit anymore! I think we should go. Uh - huh. Just like Oscar the Grouch. Pepi! Poppa Homer! Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now. Your son Bart sounds very bad. Oh, he is. Son, I just want you to know I love you very much. Shaddap! Mmm... grapefruit. I just press this button and the door opens like magic. Why does it stop there? Because it\\'s a stupid piece of junk! Well, I\\'d better get you home. What\\'s the matter? Uh-oh. Better not let him see me. I\\'ve spent every night of my life in the city. I have never seen the stars. Tell me more! I want to know all the constellations! Well, there\\'s... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy. Oh, Poppa Homer, you are so learned. \"Learned,\" son, it\\'s pronounced \"learned.\" I love you, Poppa Homer. I love you too, Pepsi. Pepi. Pepi. MUST YOU BE FOREVER DIALING THAT PHONE?!!! Excuse me. Oh, c\\'mon! Hurry! Lisa? Aw, Lisa. You tried your best. At the tone, the time will be: Twelve midnight. I made it! Hey, Homer, have you seen my skateboard? I gave it to Pepi. Who the hell is Pepi? He\\'s my little brother. That\\'s right -- you\\'re not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization. Who needs you? Tom\\'s a better father than you ever were. Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing? I was faking it. Liar! Oh yeah? Remember this? \"Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!...\" Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! You know, the whale is not really a fish. They\\'re mammals like you and me. Is that true? No. Come \\'n\\' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin. Hey! He\\'s got my hotdog! Oh... it\\'s you. So, you\\'re looking well. Come on, Bart. You know better than to talk to strangers. For your information, I\\'m his father! His father? The drunk and gambler? That\\'s right. And who might you be? There you go, fellas. Look! There\\'s another disadvantaged boy. Where? There\\'s a couple of guys fighting at the Aquarium, Chief. They still sell those frozen bananas? I think so. Let\\'s roll. This just in, a fist fight is in progress in downtown Springfield. Early reports indicate -- and these are very preliminary -- that one of the fighters is a giant lizard. Do we have a source on this? Uh-huh. A bunch of drunken frat boys? All right. I could use some names. I.P. Freely? Uh... Homer? Oh. Right. This is even more painful than it looks. This is all my fault, Dad. I didn\\'t want you to get hurt. Now I need to find another little brother. And I need to find another big brother. My car\\'s gonna feel so empty on the ride home. And me, I have no ride at all. I already bought a giant ham for dinner. It\\'s gonna go to waste. Don\\'t talk about food. I\\'m so hungry. Well, goodbye. Wait! I\\'ve got an idea! An idea? Huh? Another beer, Dad? Thanks, son. I ate it. Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, \"I\\'m a hemophiliac\" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back? Yeah? Will you teach me how to do that? Sure, boy. First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That\\'s when it\\'s time to kick some back. And then when he\\'s lying on the ground... Yeah. Kick him in the ribs... Yeah. Step on his neck, and run like hell. Doin\\' the Monster Mash with you on this beautiful Valentine\\'s Day. Marty, why did you play that song today? There must be thousands of love songs. Well, it\\'s, it\\'s kind of a love song. All the monsters, enjoying each other\\'s company... dancing... holding their evil in check. You played the wrong record, didn\\'t you? Why are you doing this to me? Bah! This is just another \"Hallmark Holiday,\" cooked up to sell cards. Awww. A valentine from my granddaughter. Could I have the envelope? To Moe -- From Your Secret Admirer. Yoo hoo! Oh, God, no. And this is for my Huggy Bug in honor of this special day. Happy... Valentine\\'s Day! Ah, thank you, dear. Woo hoo! Oh, no. It\\'s a package from Ralph. I\\'ll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad? Uh, kind of. Nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine\\'s Day. IF YOU THINK I\\'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH... Hey, Dad. Why don\\'t you give Mom her present? What a nice idea, son. It\\'s uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I\\'ll just go get it. Apu, you gotta help me! I need a valentine\\'s gift for my wife. Perhaps this might be appropriate. Yes! You saved my life. How much? One hundred dollars. What? That\\'s highway robbery! I won\\'t pay it! Ohh, I think you will. Forget it, pal! La da de / La da da... La da dum da de da da dum da dum da de All right. But I\\'ll never shop here again. If he discovers the discount supermarket next door, all is lost. Nickel off on expired baby food. Sold! Miss Hoover, can we exchange our valentines? Not just yet, Janey. First, we\\'re going to construct paper mailboxes to store the valentines. Isn\\'t that just pointless busywork? Bullseye. Get cracking. Yes, Ralph. My parents won\\'t let me use scissors. The children are right to laugh at you, Ralph. These things couldn\\'t cut butter. Now, take out your red crayons. Miss Hoover? Yes Ralph. I don\\'t have a red crayon. Why not? Attention everyone. This is Principal Skinner. Some student -- possibly Bart Simpson -- has been circulating candy hearts featuring crude, off-color sentiments. Well let me tell you something, Valentine\\'s Day is no joke... Sending your chick a valentine, eh? Yep. Johnny! Johnny. JOHNNY!! Cool, I broke his brain. All right, children, you may now exchange valentines. Miss Hoover? I glued my head to my shoulder. Poor Ralph. Here you go, Ralph. You choo choo choose me? Happy Valentine\\'s. All right, special holiday meal. Where do you want these beef hearts? On the floor. It doesn\\'t look very clean. Just do your job, heart-boy. Bart, what\\'s wrong? My baboon heart! Body... rejecting it... Can I walk you home... valentine? Sure, I guess. That valentine sure was funny. Glad you liked it. It says, \"choo choo choooose me,\" and there\\'s a picture of a train. Yeah. Nice gag. Uh. So... Do you like... stuff? The doctor said I wouldn\\'t have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there. Well, here\\'s my house. Hey, kids! Don\\'t forget to watch my 29th Anniversary Show -- featuring clips like this one of Sideshow Mel whacked out on wowee sauce! Everyone\\'s always kissing your ass. Well I\\'m not afraid to tell you you\\'re a . Oh, I\\'d give anything to go to that show! I\\'d sell my first-born son. Hey! You\\'ll do as your told. Ralph thinks I like him. But I only gave him a valentine \\'cause I felt sorry for him. Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it? What do you say to a boy to let him know you\\'re not interested? Well, honey, I-- Let me handle this, Marge. I\\'ve heard \\'em all. \"I like you as a friend,\" \"I think we should see other people,\" I no speak English\"... I get the idea. \"I\\'m married to the sea,\" \"I don\\'t want to kill you, but I will-- Honey, honey, I\\'d tell this boy that you\\'re very flattered, but you\\'re just not ready for this kind of thing. Thanks, Mom. And if that doesn\\'t work, six simple words: \"I\\'m not gay, but I\\'ll learn.\" Ralph, I think you\\'re nice but, I\\'m just not ready for this kind of thing. Do you understand? I guess so. Good. Dad, how do you get a girl to like you? Son, whether you want to win a girl or crack a nut, the key is persistence. Keep at it and never lose your cool. Let that be a lesson to the rest of you... nuts. Okay, dad, I\\'ll be persistent. Is that how you got mom? Your broth, Mr. President. Well, son, never underestimate the appeal of a man in uniform. Ah, yeah. Hey boys and girls, only four days `til my Anniversary Show. Twenty-nine years... and when I came on they said I wouldn\\'t last a week. And you know where those reviewers are? All dead! How ya doin\\' down there fellas? Heh, heh. Anyway, here\\'s a clip: Now, why do they call this a Urine Monkey? Ugh... I just found out. That\\'s funny for so many reasons. We have to go to that show. Forget it. To get those tickets our parents would have to be part of Springfield\\'s cultural elite. Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush? Eww. Oh no, it\\'s Ralph! Just make some excuse. She\\'s in the can. Go away. Yes, sir. I\\'d do anything for Lisa. Really? Mr. Simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy. Yeah, they\\'ll do that. \"Dearest Martha, since boyhood I have yearned to be on the one-dollar bill. And with your help, this I shall achieve. Sincerely, George Washington.\" Thank you, Rex. I\\'ve selected the cast for our President\\'s Day pageant. Martha Washington will be played by Lisa Simpson. George Washington will be played by... Ralph Wiggum. What? This is a travesty! Everyone knows I\\'m the best actor in this ridiculous school. Sit down, Rex. I will not sit down. Someone\\'s gotten to you, you deceitful cow. That\\'s absurd, Rex. Ralph won the part fair and square. That\\'s the signal. Take the boot off the car, boys. Now Ralph is in this play with me. I just know he\\'s going to embarrass me in front of the whole school. Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! \"Look in the tunk.\" He must mean trunk. Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show! Oh, he must want me to go with him. Oh, it isn\\'t fair. I\\'m ten times the Krusty fan you are. I even have the Krusty home pregnancy test. I\\'m not sure I should go. I don\\'t even like him. You\\'re right, Lis. You shouldn\\'t go. It wouldn\\'t be honest. I\\'ll go, disguised as you. What if he wants to hold hands? I\\'m prepared to make that sacrifice. What if he wants a kiss? I\\'m prepared to make that sacrifice. What if he... You don\\'t want to know how far I\\'ll go. Dad, is it right to take things from people you don\\'t like? Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don\\'t you? Well, actually, it\\'s not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me. Your conscience? Lisa, don\\'t let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do. Homer, that\\'s a terrible thing to say. Oh, shaddup. Yes, sir. I am so glad you cho-cho-chose to come. Hmm, I think you should give that a rest, Ralph. Chief Wiggum, how did you ever get these tickets? Krusty knows how to play ball. Ah, nothin\\' beats a good porno movie. Chief Wiggum! Is this a bust? Uh. Yeah. That\\'s just what it is, a bust. That story isn\\'t suitable for children. Really? I keep my pants on in this version. Eiw. It\\'s the Krusty the Clown 29th Anniversary Show! Hey! Thank you, thank you. Hey, Mr. President! I campaigned for the other guy, but I voted for you. Y\\'know, I started this show so long ago, the Ayatollah only had a goatee. Ha! Ha! What\\'s the matter, don\\'t you people read the papers? Ahh, let\\'s look at some clips. He will not see me stopping here / To watch his woods fill up with snow... Hey, Frosty, you want some snow, man? Baaa! We discussed this and I said \"No.\" Now here\\'s a clip from 1973. TRY TO RUN / TRY TO HIDE / BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE... What was I on? Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream? No, thanks. Send it this way, boy. Whoops. Aw. Aw. Nothing gets chocolate out. See? I\\'ve worked with some marvelous second bananas over the years... But none more memorable than Sideshow Raheem. Eh, the script says I\\'m supposed to bonk you with this. I wouldn\\'t. Right on. Angry, angry young man. Now, for my favorite part of the show: Whazzat say? Talk to the audience!? Oh, God, this is always death. All right. Oh no. Please don\\'t show me with Ralph. What\\'s your name, son? Ralph. And is this your girlfriend, Ralph? Yes! I love Lisa Simpson and when I grow up I\\'m going to marry her. Noooo!! Now you listen to me -- I don\\'t like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is `cause nobody else would! First prize... first prize... Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half. A-a-a-a-and, now. At least you guys are my friends. Son, I know just how you feel. You got a great little girl and the world\\'s your oyster! No, Dad, she made a fool out of me. Heyyy... Come to think of it, she did. Well, she didn\\'t reckon with the awesome power of the chief of police. Now, where did I put my badge? Hey! That duck\\'s got it. Aw, come on! Come on! Give that back. I need it. Ah, keep it. Something wrong, officer? Yeah. You got a tail-light out. Where? Right there. You know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops. They are? Oh, no! Have they set a date? This orange drink is the only way to recoup our terrible losses from \"Fire Drill Follies.\" I just don\\'t know what went wrong. You opened the show with a fire drill and everyone cleared out. Hmm. So mother was right -- it was my fault. Go ahead, water it down some more. My god, man! I\\'ve watered her down as far as she\\'ll go. I canna water no more. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a wonderful evening of theater and picking up after yourselves. We begin with a tribute to our lesser-known Presidents. WE ARE THE MEDIOCRE PRES-I-DENTS / YOU WON\\'T FIND OUR FACES / ON DOLLARS OR ON CENTS / THERE\\'S TAYLOR/ THERE\\'S TYLER / THERE\\'S FILLMORE AND THERE\\'S HAYES / THERE\\'S WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON... I DIED IN THIRTY DAYS! We... are... the... ADEQUATE / FORGETTABLE / OCCASIONALLY REGRETTABLE / CARETAKER PRESIDENTS OF THE U... S... A...! Hey, girls. Check out this President. I am not a butt. Miss Hoover. Bart, do you want to play John Wilkes Booth, or do you want to act like a maniac? I\\'ll be good. Ralph, I\\'m sorry I... Leave me alone. I\\'m here to play George Washington. Uh... Ralph? Miss Hoover, this beard\\'s giving me a rash. Milhouse, you have one line and then you\\'re shot. Now get out there. I thought that Civil War would never end. Now to soothe my head with an evening at Ford\\'s Theater. Oh, no! John Wilkes Booth! Hasta la vista, Abie. C\\'mon, boy! Finish him off! You\\'re next, Chester A. Arthur! Unhand me, Yankee. And now, our evening comes to an end... Woo hoo! ... with a thorough re-telling of the life of George Washington. Dear, dear George Washington. Can this liberty you dream of be worth all this bloodshed? Well, can it? Dear madam. Would you put a price on the air we breathe, or the Providence that sustains us? But couldn\\'t we just give in to the British? Never! That boy is magnificent. He makes me want to learn more about our founding fathers. To the library! Yeah. Dear Martha. I fear my time is at hand. Oh, George... I asked for no broth. Away with you, lest my cane find your backside! Hm. Yes. Please don\\'t leave me, George. Dear wife, If I could take but one treasure with me to the next life, it would be your tender kiss. Now that\\'s a man. I dinna cry when me own father was hung for stealing a pig. But I\\'ll cry now. FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA! Thanks for coming. And don\\'t forget to purchase some orange drink for the long ride home. Ralph! / Ralph, sign my book. / Kiss my hand! / Etc. Lisa! Hi, Ralph. You were great tonight. Ah, thanks. I\\'ve got something for you. Let\\'s bee friends. It says \"bee\" and there\\'s a picture of a bee on it! I thought you\\'d like it. Aww. Lookit that. Attention all units! Riot in progress at... Not tonight. Hey hey! Bill and Marty here wrapping up a beautiful President\\'s Day. To George and Abe and all the rest, here\\'s a special song just for you. Dog gone it. Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair. Go-go ray? Allow me to demonstrate. Dah! What the...? Can\\'t... stop... doing... The Monkey! I\\'m disrupting the learning process... and I love it! First prize! First prize... first prize... First prize... first prize... Why are you saying that? Just screwing with your mind. Homer, I want you to encourage Lisa with her science fair project. Yeah, syrup is better than jelly. I\\'ve grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with Anabolic steroids. The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence? The very same. I think this tomato could wipe out world hunger. More tomato? Yes please! Where\\'s your Science Fair project, boy? I thought I\\'d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs. Bart, don\\'t give the dog cigarettes! Whelp, time to go to work. Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That\\'s the plan. Then to the Duff Brewery. I gotta think of a lie, fast. Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery? If the plant ye wish to flee, go to sector 7-B. To overcome the spider\\'s curse, simply quote a bible verse. Uh, thou shall not... Hey, that looks like Princess Di! Ah, wait. It\\'s just a pile of rags. Oh Bart, I forgot my math book. Would you hold this for me, please? Soitenly. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Whoop. Shoe\\'s untied. Over, under, in and out, that\\'s what shoe tying\\'s all about. Nooooo! Bart!!!!! Welcome to the Duff Brewery. Now I\\'m sure all of you have heard the rumors that a batch of Duff was contaminated with Strychnine. Strychnine? / First I\\'ve heard of it. / News to me. / Etc. Are you sure? Everyone\\'s talking about it. It was even on CNN last night. CNN? / Wow. / No we didn\\'t. / Etc. Well it\\'s not true. Let\\'s go. Now here\\'s one of our favorite Duff Beer commercials from the early 1950s. Only Duff fills your q-zone with pure beer goodness. So drink up. And up! And up! Duff Beer! Proud sponsors of Amos and Andy. We\\'re proud of all our Duff commercials. But here\\'s a very special one from 1960. Well, I would suggest Mr. Vanocur, that if you knew the president, that that was probably a facetious remark... And now a word from our sponsor. I would like to take this opportunity to express my fondness for Duff beer. I\\'d also like to express my fondness for that particular beer. The man never drank a Duff in his life. ... And here we have Duff, Duff Lite, and our newest flavor, Duff Dry. What does the future hold for Duff? Let\\'s just say we\\'ve got a few ideas up our sleeve. Like what? Um, I\\'d rather not get into it right now. Why not? All right, we don\\'t have any ideas for the future. We got nothing. Happy? No. Mom, Bart wrecked my project and the science fair\\'s in three days! Well, I got an idea! Why don\\'t you run a hamster through a maze? Help me! Help me! What\\'s so funny? Oh... I was just thinking of a joke I saw on \"Herman\\'s Head.\" Now this is the most important man on the tour. He\\'s in charge of quality control. Fine. Fine. Mouse. Fine. Mouse. Rat. Fine. Syringe. Fine. Nose. Fine. Lemme just say, you\\'re doin\\' a great job, Phil. Hey, thanks a lot. That makes it all worthwhile. Mmmm... Gummi Beer. Hey, Barney. I think you\\'ve had enough. Are you crazy? We still haven\\'t tried Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff, Tartar Control Duff... Barney, give me your keys. You\\'re too drunk to drive. I\\'m fine. Okay, you leave me no option. Ow. What was that for? I\\'m trying to knock you out. Ow, cut it out. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Awright, here, take the keys! Look alive, boys. Coupla stewed prunes headed your way. Gulp. W,X,Y, AND Z / NOW I KNOW MY ABC\\'S / WON\\'T YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME? Flawless. We also would have accepted \"Tell me what you think of me.\" I guess you\\'re free to... Give him a breathalizer! Gee, thanks. You\\'re under arrest. You think you can get this car home? Sure thing, Giant Beer. Ow! Ooh... ow... Mother of Mercy... Hey, this is kinda fun. Whee!! Hello. Ah, yeah, Mrs. Simpson, I have some bad news. Your husband was found DOA. Oh my God. He\\'s dead? Oh, wait. I mean DWI. I always get those two mixed up. My name is Mrs. Phillips. You said my husband is DWI. Uh... why don\\'t you talk to that officer over there? I\\'m going out to lunch. Don\\'t worry, Homer. I have a foolproof strategy to get you out of here. Surprise witnesses. Each more surprising than the last. I tell you, the judge won\\'t know what hit him. Augh! Pipe down in there, Hutz. Your license is hereby revoked and you are to attend traffic school and two months of Alch-anon meetings. Your Honor, I\\'d like that last remark stricken from the record. No. It doesn\\'t get any better than this. I want the most intelligent hamster you\\'ve got. Okayyy... This little guy writes mysteries under the name of J. D. MacGregor. How can a hamster write mysteries? Well, he gets the ending first, then he works backward. Oh, come on. Look kid, just take him before his mother eats him. All right? Have a good day at work, honey. Haw haw! Stupid bicycle. Can\\'t believe this. No good, rotten... I guess it\\'s not all bad. I propose to determine the answer to the question: \"Is my brother dumber than a hamster?\" Hey Lis, look what I can do. Doggone it. Remarkable. Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake. Uh-huh. Aaahhh! Hamster one... Bart... zero. Experiment two: The food is connected to a mild electrical current. The hamster has learned a valuable lesson. Beware the hand of man. Oooh - wise guy, eh? Ow... ow... ow! Hampster two... Bart zero... Now if any of you ever think of drinking and driving again, this film will scare the pants off of you. Guys, guys, this is the wrong movie. Oh, wait a second, I do something really funny here. What a terrible waste. Hi! I\\'m actor, Troy McClure. You might remember me from such Driver\\'s Ed films as \"Alice\\'s Adventures through the Windshield Glass\" and \"The Decapitation of Larry Leadfoot.\" For the next 60 minutes we\\'ll be seeing actual film of car crash victims. It\\'s funny `cause I don\\'t know him. Heh, heh, heh. I\\'m here for the Alch-anon meeting. Huh uh, third door on your left. Coping with senility? No! I\\'m here for microwave cookery. No, wait. Coping with senility. My name is Ned. Hello Ned. It\\'s been four thousand days since my last drink. It was my first and last Blackberry schnapps. Ned, did you clip Ann Landers today? Ann Landers is a boring old biddy. Ned! I was more animal than man. My name is Ot-to. I love to get blot-to. My name is Hans. Drinking has ruined my life. I\\'m thirty-one years old. My name is Homer and I\\'m just here because the court made me come. Homer, with our help you\\'ll never touch a beer again. So they say I might have a problem. Homie, do you ever drink alone? Does the Lord count as a person? No. Then, yes. Do you need a beer to fall asleep? Thank you, that\\'d be nice. Do you ever hide beer around the house? Do I ever! Ah. Do you ever drink to escape from reality? Homie, I\\'d like you to do something for me. You name it. I want you to give up beer for a month. You got it. No deer for a month. Did you say beer or deer? Deer. Please, Homie, I know you can do this. All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month. What was that noise? I was saying \"Pssst. I love you.\" Bart, could you go get the cupcakes? Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all. Well, beer... we\\'ve had some great times. WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN WHEN I WAS 17. Huh? She\\'ll pay for this. I\\'m gonna crush her like this pellet. Ow! Ow! Ow! Looking for something? What have you done with my report? I\\'ve hidden it. To find it, you\\'ll need to decipher a series of clues, each more fiendish than the... Got it. Behold gravity! In all its glory. Pretty lame, Milhouse. Can I touch it? I\\'ve worked too long and hard on this for you to screw it up now. But it\\'s got my name on it. Just stand over there. Over there! Behold the flying machine that will carry me, Phileas Fogg, around the world in 80 days! Dang, I was aiming for his head. Hm. Alcohol fueled car. One for you... one for me... One for you... one for me... I don\\'t know if I like you experimenting on your brother. Please, Mother. It\\'s purely in the interest of science. Step right up folks! We\\'ll answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages. Can hamsters fly planes? Oooh, look he\\'s got miniature goggles on! And a little scarf, isn\\'t that adorable? But this project has no scientific merit. Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don\\'t think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize! One down. Twenty-nine to go. DOWN WITH SEXISM! DOWN WITH SEXISM! DOWN WITH SEXISM! Huh, look at all those feminists. You thinking what I\\'m thinking? T.V. have you turned on me, too? The windup and the two two pitch... Oh no! The batter is calling for time... Looks like he\\'s going and getting himself a new bat. And now there\\'s a beachball on the field. And the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it. I never realized how boring this game is. I think I\\'ve lost weight. You\\'ve never looked better. Thank you all for coming. We\\'ve got some very interesting developments in the field of Supperware. Uh huh. This is the 128 ounce tub. You can fit your whole head in it. Don\\'t be scared Jubjub. It\\'s mama. I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer. So Homer, please feel free to tell us anything. There\\'s no judgment here. The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers. I cast thee out! Don\\'t think about beer... Don\\'t think about beer... Don\\'t think about beer... Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug. Nooooo! Thirty days! I\\'m proud of you, Homie. Marge, I\\'m going to Moe\\'s. Send the kids to the neighbors, I\\'m comin\\' back loaded. You don\\'t have to start drinking right away. I was thinking we could go for a bike ride. But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill... But you look better... you don\\'t sweat while you eat anymore... and look. You\\'ve saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants. Yoink. Age fourteen. Well, well look who it is. Mr. \"I don\\'t need alcohol to enjoy life.\" We hate him, right fellas? Moe, gimme a beer. Hey everybody! Homer\\'s back! C\\'mon Homer. Do it for your old pal Moesy. But Moe. Yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of... Pipe down, rub-a-dub. Ow. Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife. You\\'ll be back. And so will you... and you... And you! Of course I\\'ll be back. If you didn\\'t close, I\\'d never leave. RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD... BUT THAT DOESN\\'T MEAN MY EYES WILL SOON BE TURNING RED... LA LA LA LA LA LA... LA... My friends. Tonight, we unveil my most diabolical creation.... \"Swank.\" Ten times more addictive than marijuana. To human misery. McBain! Ah, McBain. So glad you could make it. Have a salmon puff. That is one evil dude. It\\'s just a movie, son. There\\'s nobody that evil in real life. Eh. Smithers, where\\'s that union representative? He\\'s twenty minutes late. I don\\'t know, sir. He hasn\\'t been seen since he promised to clean up the union. Whoa! What the hell? Age seventeen. Dental Plan. Well let\\'s look at the contract ourselves. Benefits... perks... a green cookie on St. Patrick\\'s Day? Oh, it didn\\'t used to be this way, Smithers. No, it didn\\'t used to be this way at all... Come on! Come on! Crack those atoms! You... turn out those pockets. Atoms... Six of them! Take him away. You can\\'t treat the working man this way. One day we\\'ll form a union and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve. Then we\\'ll go too far, and get corrupt and shift-less and the Japanese will eat us alive! The Japanese!? Those sandal-wearing goldfish tenders? Bosh! Flimshaw. If only we had listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven. Well, I\\'m going to avenge my grandfather. We\\'ll take on that greedy union and get back our... Dental Plan. How often do you brush, Ralph? Three times a day, sir. Why must you turn my office into a house of lies? You\\'re right, I don\\'t brush. I don\\'t brush... Let\\'s look at a picture book, \"The Big Book of British Smiles.\" That\\'s enough. That\\'s enough. Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids\\' teeth so he can sell them. To who? You know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? That\\'s a kid\\'s tooth. Maggie\\'s teeth are coming in crooked. Has she been sucking on a pacifier? Uh... not to my knowledge. Liar! I\\'m also afraid Lisa is going to need braces. Oh no. I\\'ll be socially unpopular. More so. Are you sure, Doctor? Well, judge for yourself. Here\\'s Lisa today... Without treatment, here\\'s what she\\'ll look like at age eleven. And finally, age eighteen. Cool. She\\'ll be a freak. Bart! We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South, and charge two bits a gander. Now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the Springfield Grapplarium! Tonight, a Texas death match... Dr. Hillbilly vs. the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring! I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he\\'s so big. Homer, Lisa needs Braces. Don\\'t worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That\\'s where I got this scar. What do we want? More equitable treatment at the hands of management! When do we want it? Soon! Where\\'s my burrito? Where\\'s my burrito? Where\\'s my burrito? Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet. Welcome brothers of Local 643. As you know, our president, Chucky Fitzhugh, ain\\'t been seen lately. We\\'re all praying he\\'ll turn up soon, alive and well. All right, all right, but seriously, we have to vote on Burns\\' new contract. It\\'s basically the same deal, except we get a free keg of beer for our meetings. And in exchange for that, we have to give up our dental plan. So long dental plan! Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Bullseye! Thanks a lot Carl. Now I\\'ve lost my train of thought. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. Dental Plan. Lisa needs braces. If we give up our dental plan, I\\'ll have to pay for Lisa\\'s braces. People stop! We can\\'t give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn\\'t have that diamond in your tooth. Yoink! Hey! And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan? I wouldn\\'t have old chomper here, that\\'s for sure. You know what I think of this contract? Who is that firebrand, Smithers? That\\'s Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh?... New man? Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor... you ran over his son... he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted your portrait-- Doesn\\'t ring a bell. Homer! Homer! Homer! I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president. All in favor... Aye! All opposed? Nay. Congratulations, Homer! Hey, what does this job pay? Nothin\\'. ... Unless you\\'re crooked. Woo hoo! President of the union! I\\'m so proud of you, Homie. This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man. And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime. Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you. Mmm. Gratzi. Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the... Eh-Eh-Eh. Molto bene. That\\'s-a-nice-a-donut. Do you think you can get the dental plan back? Well, that depends on who\\'s a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me. Dad, I\\'ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol\\' danish. Done and done! Heh, heh, heh. Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein\\'s Obsession for teeth. Mmmm. Doctor, we don\\'t have a dental plan right now. So we\\'ll need something a little more... affordable. These pre-date stainless steel so you can\\'t get them wet. Hmm, he\\'s a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine. Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back? Okay, but it\\'s the last time. We don\\'t have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract. And, if you scratch my back, I\\'ll scratch yours. I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what\\'s the harm? After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows. Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don\\'t go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I\\'m flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no. Lisa, so you won\\'t be scared, I\\'ll show you some of the tools I\\'ll be using. This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow is the gouger. Uh huh. Now, the first thing I\\'ll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- bone. Hold still while I gas you. Look fellas! It\\'s Lisa in the sky. No diamonds, though. Look out for that campy drawing of Queen Victoria! For the love of God, help us! The mirror. The mirror! Honey, you look fine. Who is it? Goons. Who? Hired goons. Hired goons? Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn\\'t hurt you. You know, you could have just called me. Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons. Hired goons? This is the largest TV in the free world. Aiiee! Un gato malodoro! This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they\\'ll have written the greatest novel known to man. Let\\'s see. \"It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?\" You stupid monkey! Ohh, shut up. And this is my basement. Gee, it\\'s not as nice as the other rooms. Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it. Now, let\\'s get down to business. Now, Homer, I know what you\\'re thinking and I want to take the pressure off. It doesn\\'t take a whiz to see that you\\'re looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you\\'ll make a big splash very soon. Which way to the bathroom? Oh. It\\'s the twenty-third door on the left. Nope. Nope. Nope. Ah, he wouldn\\'t even hear me out. Find the bathroom alright? Uh... yeah. Well, you\\'ve won this round Simpson, but I\\'ll grind you into the earth like a bug! Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back. A bug, I tell you! A bug! I\\'m gonna resign. I don\\'t know why they made me Union President in the first place. Because they love you down at the plant. Yeah, you\\'re right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh... That doesn\\'t sound like they like you at all. Ya know, I think you\\'re right. First thing tomorrow morning, I\\'m gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head. Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister. But I can\\'t. Oh, sorry Quigley. Come on, honey, smile. I bet you\\'ve got a beautiful smile. Why don\\'t you share it with the world? We can always stick in a \"Photo Not Available\" card. Fellow workers, I\\'ve been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I\\'ve had enough. Strike! Strike! Strike! All in favor of a strike... Aye! All opposed? Nay. Who keeps saying that? It was him. Let\\'s get him, fellows. COME GATHER \\'ROUND CHILDREN / IT\\'S HIGH-TIME YE LEARNS / \\'BOUT A HERO NAMED HOMER / AND A DEVIL NAMED BURNS / WE\\'LL MARCH TILL WE DROP / THE GIRLS AND THE FELLAS / WILL FIGHT TILL THE DEATH OR ELSE FOLD LIKE UMBRELLAS Ahhh. This is the life. Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30\\'s. We can\\'t bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell them stories that don\\'t go anywhere... Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. \"Give me five bees for a quarter\" you\\'d say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn\\'t have white onions, because of the war... Full power, Smithers. SO WE\\'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER / THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER. Now do \"Classical Gas.\" Oooo, look at him strutting around like he\\'s cock of the walk. Well, let me tell you, Homer Simpson is cock of nothing. Why you and I can run this plant ourselves. Crush, kill, destroy... I brought my own mike! Yes, well, Homer, organized labor has been called a lumbering dinosaur. Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore. Woo hoo! Uh, Mr. Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade? Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one! A chilling vision of things to come. Homer, any thoughts? Oh for God\\'s sake. Goodbye, Springfield. From hell\\'s heart I stab at thee! SO WE\\'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER... THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER... Look at them all, through the darkness I\\'m bringing. They\\'re not sad at all, they\\'re actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I\\'m ready to deal All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union. Woo hoo! Smithers, I\\'m beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was. Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop! We\\'re going back to work! Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces. And that\\'s the tooth! Oops. I left the gas on. Oh no, I can\\'t see! I\\'m blind! Blind! Haw haw. April Fool\\'s. Haw, haw. April Fool\\'s! I\\'ve been keepin\\' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker! You\\'re goin\\' down, Homer! I\\'m gonna fool you! You talk better than you fool. I\\'ll fool you up real nice! You couldn\\'t fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine. P.U. Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool\\'s Day? Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool\\'s Day traces its origins to pagan ritual. God bless those pagans. April first used to be the Pagan New Year. Blood for Baal! Blood for Baal! The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn\\'t. Happy New Year! Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here\\'s a present anyhoo! It\\'s ram\\'s blood for your Godless ceremony! April Fool\\'s! Now who\\'s laughing? Now who\\'s laughing? And that\\'s the story of April Fool\\'s Day. Dad! I was telling the story. Oh, right. Thar she blows! The catch of the day! Arrrr, harrrr, harrrrrr! Why, ye mutinous dogs. From this day, I be requirin\\' hair nets! Arrrr... arrrrrr.... arrrrrr.... I\\'ve got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness. Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will. Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it... Whew! It\\'s a good thing that beer wasn\\'t shaken up any more, or I\\'d have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were. Hey kid. That\\'s for customers only. Uh, did you know there\\'s a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads? Wow, I\\'m in pizza-face paradise. Moron. Ay, no es bueno. So thirsty... Eh. What\\'re you gonna do? The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum. Mmmm... beer. April F... That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place. Forget it. That\\'s two blocks away. It looks like there\\'s beer coming out of the chimney. I\\'m proceeding on foot. Call in a Code eight. We need pretzels! Repeat! Pretzels! Mrs. Simpson, I\\'m afraid your husband is dead. April Fool\\'s! He\\'s very much alive... although I\\'m afraid he may never walk again. ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT, GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM... Homie! Marge! Homer has many, many horrible problems. These shadows are brain lesions resulting from numerous blows to the head... And his brain waves are disturbingly erratic. ...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock-- Arrrgh! Just testing. Arrrgh! Bart, how could you shock your little sister? My finger slipped. Arrrgh! So did mine. Bart! Lisa! Stop that. Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! Arrrgh! No, no. No! No, wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Folks! Folks, if I could... Not yet! This is not the way to get healthy! Mrs. Simpson, can you think of anything to account for all this? I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff. I won\\'t jump anymore, I promise. Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever felt as close to you as I do right -- I\\'m going to make it! I\\'m going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I\\'m king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I-- Hmm. That still wouldn\\'t explain what I\\'m seeing here. You look familiar. Have we met before? Clear! Ugh... Clear! Doctor... he\\'s gone. This is the part of the job I hate. You\\'re a veterinarian? That\\'s right. And for an extra twenty dollars I\\'ll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him. Here ya go, Doc. Bart! Shop around. You can\\'t beat that price. You guys must have been pretty worried about me. Hey, we know you\\'re tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest? This is a trap. It\\'s going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy. Shhhh! Just watch. Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him! Okay, okay. This time I\\'ll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him. Right, Dad. Get \\'em off me! Get \\'em off me! Get \\'em off me! It\\'s true. You have good coping skills. The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly. And there\\'s one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever forget. Why\\'d you bring that up? It was an amusing episode... of our lives. Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe. I brought you a little present. No! No! Beer bring pain! I can\\'t stand to see him like this! He really needs a girlfriend. Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed. Society\\'s loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through. Marge! What a lovely surprise! You\\'re here to see me, right? Of course. Hey! Way to go, Homer. Way to go. Hey, what\\'ll I tell the boss? Tell him I\\'m going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won\\'t be back for ten minutes. You can do it, Homer. Stand up. I can\\'t. He just won\\'t budge. I\\'ve tried everything. Nothing can reach him. Mmm... chocolate. Wow. Chocolate -- half price! Mmmm, chocolate. Can\\'t breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts. Oh, yeah. Poor Homer. This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you. Ahhh! Kill it! Kill it! Grampa, please. He\\'s in a coma. Coma? Why, I go in and out of comas all the... French toast, please. Is a coma painful? Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it\\'s like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes. Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he\\'s thinking now. This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity. Now look, I\\'m the doctor here! Well, I demand a second opinion. Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr. Nick! Oof. And sometimes I got into trouble... Oh, dear. I see no signs of life. Just to be safe, we better pull the plug. Yoink. Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted? You have no idea, woman, what that man\\'s put me through. Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money. Please, do go on... I know you\\'re a good man... and I have a dog that\\'s very sick... Oh, please, continue... I thought maybe you... Oh. Well, thanks for your time. I have an unorthodox solution: a \"fantastic voyage\", if you will. Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson\\'s lower colon -- Eww. Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers... I wish I\\'d gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected. Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket? No. Let me hear you play. Why? Does a father have to explain? Let\\'s just share your gift, okay? Yeah, that\\'s more like it! \"OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE.\" I wrote this for you, Dad. Dad, I\\'m so sorry. I know I haven\\'t been a perfect kid... Why you little... What the... I know that I got you mad once in a while... Bart, you can\\'t go on like this. I know. ...but you always looked out for me. Homer, it\\'s really coming down. Could you check on the boys? They\\'re fine. And no matter what happens, I\\'ll never forget the advice you gave me. Now, come on. You\\'re gonna learn how to shave. ...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you\\'re bleeding. There and there. Don\\'t worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave. Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that\\'s how we shave. Dad, it\\'s all my fault! I shook up that can of beer! It was just an April Fool\\'s joke. Why, you little -- Homie! You\\'re all right! We\\'re a family again! This calls for a celebration. We\\'re all going to Hawaii! Gotcha! It\\'s April Fool\\'s for two more minutes! Dad, it\\'s May 16th. You were in that coma for seven weeks. Uh-huh. You lost five percent of your brain. Me lose brain? Uh-oh. Why\\'d I laugh? Mmm. Delicious. Now, Krusty, I hear it\\'s your birthday, so I got your mother\\'s recipe for matzoh brei. Hey, I don\\'t do the Jewish stuff on the air. But Herschel, bubbeleh -- Ix-nay on the Ew-Jay! Roll the cartoon. It\\'s so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots. Marge, it happened again! What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up? Lois Sanborn. Steve Bennett. Ow. He, he, he. Ow. He, he, he. Ow. He, he, he. This is a rather lifeless outing. Don\\'t worry. They\\'re building to something. Ow. He, he, he. Kids, say no to drugs. I could pull a better cartoon out of my A... Hey, whoa! Wasn\\'t that great, kids? That\\'s as bad as the tasteless Itchy and Sambo cartoons of the late 30s. The writers should be ashamed of themselves. Cartoons have writers? Yeah, sort of. Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that. Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what I\\'m thinking? Probably not. Lie in the snow and count to sixty. Giddiyup! Merry Christmas, suckers. \"Third Notice,\" \"Final Notice,\" \"Some Guys are Coming.\"... Ooh, what\\'s this? An invitation to our High School Reunion. Gee, that\\'s odd. They didn\\'t send one to you. Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom. Oh my God. Marge, I never graduated from high school. Well that still doesn\\'t explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does. I never passed remedial science one \"A\". And you\\'re a nuclear technician? Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay. What did you way? I don\\'t know. I flunked Latin, too. According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting. Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting... How about a barber shop? Great. Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy\\'s head off with a razor! Eh, too predictable. The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchy\\'s hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself. Eh, this show ain\\'t no good. Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it. Fine. Put my name first. No way. All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag. Look there\\'s only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors. Rock. Paper. But sir, at Harvard they taught me to... Sir, a Lisa and Bart Simpson sent you a script... \"Ishy and Wha?\" Uh, you must be some kind of crazy person! Okely, dokely do! Good ol\\' rock. Nothing beats that. Poor predictable Bart. Always takes rock. Fair Harvard I You, sir, have the boorish manners of a Yalie. Bart, they rejected our script. I guess we\\'re just not cut out to be writers. Maybe he just doesn\\'t take us seriously \\'cause we\\'re kids. Let\\'s put a grownup\\'s name on it. Well, how about Grampa? He\\'s pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year. ... when I read your magazine I don\\'t see one wrinkled face or a single toothless grin. For shame! To the sickos at \"Modern Bride\" magazine. Hey Grampa, we need to know your first name. You\\'re making my tombstone! No, we\\'re just curious. All right, let\\'s see. First name... first name... well, whenever I\\'m confused, I just check my underwear. It holds the answer to all the important questions. Call me... Abraham Simpson! Grampa, how\\'d you take off your underwear without taking off your pants? I don\\'t know. Sir, you locked my office, and I wanted to get my Harvard mug. Phone call, Simpson. Beh? Is this the Abraham Simpson who wrote the \"Itchy and Scratchy\" episode? I\\'m sorry, but we have a substantial check here for a Mr. Abraham Simpson. That\\'s right, I did the Iggy. Ah, my high school yearbook... You handsome devil. I can\\'t believe I ate the whole thing. \"Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none.\" So many memories. Time to go to the reunion. It\\'ll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, \"The Fonz\"... That was \"Happy Days.\" No, they weren\\'t all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back. Hello, Principal Dondelinger. Marge Bouvier, it\\'s so good to see you. Sorry, sir. We\\'re not letting vagrants sleep in the gym tonight. But we will be putting some scraps by the back door. Oh, it\\'s you Simpson. Look, there\\'s Bobby Mindich, the class clown. I am not a crook. Richard Nixon. I know. Oh my God, it\\'s my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff. Hello, Marge. Have you heard? I\\'m stinking rich. Jealous? I\\'ll bet you\\'d trade it all for one night with my wife. I would. Hmmm. Homer! Hey, man. It\\'s Dave. Open up man. Dave\\'s not here, man. Okay now, let\\'s move on... Grampa? Grampa? The guy\\'s so high, he doesn\\'t even know that\\'s Dave. Homer? Homer? Homer\\'s not here, man. Okay, very good. Now, let\\'s get on with our rilly big shew... Ed Sullivan. Shhhh. ... First, the award for the alumnus who\\'s gained the most weight... Homer Simpson! Oh my God! How\\'d you do it, Homer? I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch. And now, the award for most improved odor... Homer Simpson! Yes! And the person who traveled the least distance to be here... well, kiss my grits... Homer Simpson! What can I say? It hasn\\'t been easy staying in my rut... Class of \\'74, I was just uh leafing through your permanent records when I discovered something shocking. Homer Simpson never passed Remedial Science 1A and thus never graduated from high school. I\\'m sorry, Simpson, but I-I\\'m gonna have to take back those awards. This is Howard Cosmell. Homer Simpson is a boob. What do you think, J.J.? Dynomite! Didn\\'t graduate. How low can you get? Barney, where\\'s your cummerbund? It fell in the toilet. Marge, I have my pride. I\\'m going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy! I want my check! I want another one. My chest hurts. Actually, you know, I wrote my thesis on life experience... and... I spent forty years as a night watchman at a cranberry silo. So this patch steadily releases nicotine into my body, eliminating my need for a cigarette. Roll the cartoon. Bart! Our Cartoon\\'s on TV! All right! Turn up the volume. Erosion is a slow but steady process... Eh, this show ain\\'t no good. Bart, Lisa I have something to tell you, and I\\'m not proud of it. Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect. I never graduated from high school. Hello, son! I was on my way home from work and thought I\\'d drop by. Oh, you have a job? They pay me eight hundred dollars a week to tell a cat and a mouse what to do. I see. Lalalalalalalalalalalala. Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute? All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar. ... then we put your name on the script and sent it in. Didn\\'t you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing? I figured \\'cause the Democrats were in power again. Grampa, we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways. I dunno. I\\'d better sleep on it. Why\\'d you wake me? I was having the nicest dream. I dreamt I was the Queen of the Old West. I kept a six shooter in my garter, I did... Do we have a deal? Sure, sure. Boys! Stop! You can both marry me. Yay! Any stairs? Nuts to you! Wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons. Welcome to Remedial Science 1A. My uh wife recently passed away... I thought teaching might ease my loneliness. Will this be on the test? No. Hey Mel, bring me another nicotine patch. I think there\\'s some space left on my butt. And now, here\\'s another fine Itchy and Scratchy cartoon by Abraham Simpson. Now, I\\'m going to uh burn this donut to show you how many calories it has. Nooooooo! The bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet donut. This is not happening. This is not happening. Dear Mr. President. There are too many states nowadays. Please eliminate three. I am not a crackpot. Who are you? In a minute! Oh no! We\\'re all doomed! I\\'m a complete fraud. All right, here are your exams. Fifty questions, true or false. True. Homer, I was just describing the test. True. Look, Homer, just take the test and you\\'ll do fine. False. All right, brain, you don\\'t like me and I don\\'t like you. But let\\'s just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer. Thank you for this award. It is a tribute to this great country, that a man who once took a shot at Teddy Roosevelt could win back your trust. Yo, Grampa! Time for the awards. Did you call the girl from the escort service? They said their insurance won\\'t cover you. Ooh, that\\'s an onion in the ointment. And now to present the award for outstanding writing in a cartoon series, Krusty the Clown and Brooke Shields. Well, here we are, the star of \"The Blue Lagoon,\" and me, \"The Blue Haired Goon.\" What the... that\\'s terrible. Cartoons have the power to make us laugh and to make us cry. Wouldn\\'t you agree, Krusty? First of all my hair is green, not blue. I got nothin\\' to work with here, nothin\\'. Well, at least I can take off this girdle. Oh, yeah. Uh... The nominees for best writing in a cartoon series are... \"Strong-dar, Master of Akom,\" the \"Wedding\" episode. It\\'s a deal! \"Action-Figure Man,\" the \"How to Buy Action Figure Man\" episode. Please, Mommy, I want it. \"Ren and Stimpy\", season premiere. And, finally, \"Itchy and Scratchy,\" \"The Little Barber Shop of Horrors\" episode. Cross my fingers for me. That\\'s gonna hurt come winter. And the winner is... \"Itchy and Scratchy,\" Abraham Simpson writer! Ah, Grampa! Woo! That was the first time I ever saw \"Itchy and Scratchy\" and I didn\\'t like it one bit. It was disgusting and violent. I think all you people are despicable. For shame! He\\'s right! We\\'ve been wasting our lives! The hell with cartoons. I\\'m gonna do what I\\'ve always dreamed of. I\\'m gonna write that sitcom about the sassy robot. Here kids, I guess you deserve this. Let\\'s go. I guess nobody likes the truth, huh Grampa. Nope. I\\'ll never watch an awards show again... unless that delightful Billy Crystal\\'s involved. Marge! I passed! That\\'s wonderful, Homie! At our next high school reunion I\\'ll have nothing to be ashamed of. Hello, Dondelinger. Simpson, is that a plunger stuck on your head? HENS LOVE ROOSTERS/ GEESE LOVE GANDERS/ EVERYONE ELSE LOVES NED FLANDERS Not me! EVERYONE WHO COUNTS LOVES NED FLANDERS. Knock that off, you two. It\\'s time for church! We\\'re not going to church today. What?! You give me one good reason. It\\'s Saturday! HENS LOVE ROOSTERS / GEESE LOVE GANDERS / EVERYONE ELSE LOVES NED FLANDERS. Children, we\\'ve just been tipped off that Superintendent Chalmers is planning a surprise inspection. So let\\'s clean up this pigsty! On another topic, the following students have won mountain bikes: Bart Simpson... Jimbo Jones... Nelson Muntz... I want you to keep filling your shirt with crud \\'til I get back. Yes, sir. You may pick the bikes up in Utility Basement B. Fools! Whoops. Still on. Hey, what do you think he meant by that fools remark? Ah, who cares? Time to get me a mountain bike! Hey, what gives? Where are the mountain bikes? Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen. You\\'re being swept under the rug for the Superintendent\\'s visit. Enjoy! How are we gonna get outta here? And when are we gonna get our mountain bikes? Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key? No. But the PTA would tear ya a new arse. Wise council, William. But the potty talk adds nothing. Aye, sir. You bath-taking, underpants-wearing, lily-hugger. Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome! Hello, Seymour. So what\\'s the word down at One School Board Plaza? We\\'re dropping the geography requirement. The children weren\\'t testing well. It was proving to be an embarrassment. Very good. Back to the three R\\'s. Two R\\'s come October. Hm. What do you think of the banners? Nothing but transparent toadying. They were the children\\'s idea. I tried to stop them. It\\'s always the children\\'s fault, isn\\'t it, Seymour? Yes, yes it is, sir. Imagine, a school out there with no bullies. Science geeks not getting beat up... kids using their lunch money for food... I can\\'t take it! Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent. All right! All right Bart! Do it man. Now, remember little dude, you\\'re our only hope. Ow! Got \\'im! Way to go, man! Haw haw! May I interest you in a Jello brick, Sir? There\\'s a grape in the center. Well, I\\'m not made of stone. You\\'re not made of stone... a brick and you\\'re... made of stone... Ach, my beauty, wait till the Superintendent sees you. Were it not a violation of God\\'s law, I\\'d make ye my wife. Now there is a lonely man. I\\'m new in town. Be there a cool loch where a lass could wash her long red hair? Nay, but there\\'s a pool at me apartment complex. There was a rat in the deep end -- but we got him! Ah! Lead on. Forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty. Flag\\'s up to date. Very good, Seymour. Now, are these children as smart as they look? Well let\\'s pick one at random. How about that one? You mean this boy, here? No! No! Lisa Simpson! When was the battle of New Orleans? January 8, 1815. Two weeks after the war ended. First rate. What\\'s a battle? Let\\'s go. Did that boy say what\\'s a battle? No he said what\\'s that rattle. It\\'s about the heating duct. Hm, it sounded like battle. I\\'ve had a cold. Oh, so you hear \"R\"s as \"B\"s? Yes. I understand. Come on Bart. Ride me. I better not. He\\'s insulting both of us. Let\\'s go. Excellent. Not a trace of urine. Seymour, you run a tight ship. Well, you know what they say, sir. \"Where there\\'s no smoke, there\\'s no fire.\" What an odd remark. Why, that looks like a fifty cent piece. I\\'ll just bend over and get it. It seems to be caught between these two flowers. NOOOOO! Ow, ow, ow. Seymour I was thinking of promoting you to Assistant Superintendent. But, instead, that plum goes to Holloway. No. But sir, he\\'s a drunk. And a pill popper. If I could just... Silence! And why is a cafeteria worker posing as a nurse? I get two paychecks this way. There\\'s no detention this time, Simpson. This is the end. You are expelled from Springfield Elementary! Tonight on \"Eye on Springfield\": The Munchkins from \"The Wizard of Oz\"... Where are they now? And we\\'ll visit a nudist camp... for animals! But first, a look at the local holiday that was called \"distasteful\" and \"Puerile\" by a panel of hillbillies. Whacking Day! Oh no. No! In a tradition that dates back to founding father Jebediah Springfield...every May 10th local residents gather to drive snakes into the center of town and whack them to snake heaven. After exposing Alger Hiss, honorary Grand Marshall Richard Nixon goes after another deadly hiss. Is Whacking Day over? Thank you, thanks for coming out. It\\'s all so barbaric. Hey kids. How was school? I learned how many drams in a pennyweight. I got expelled. That\\'s my boy. Mmmm, beer... What? Look, Dad. I don\\'t need school. I\\'ll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv\\'nor? No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We\\'re gonna find you another school. Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here. No problemo. Now Bart, since you\\'re new here, perhaps you\\'d favor us with a psalm. How about \"Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit?\" Well, beans were a staple of the Israelites... yes, proceed. Yoo hoo. BEANS, BEANS, THE MUSICAL FRUIT / THE MORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU TOOT... Avert your eyes, children, he may take on other forms! I guess that\\'s it. I just can\\'t be educated. I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives. We\\'d like you to try this new diet cola. We call it \"Nature\\'s Goodness.\" What\\'s in it? Two four des-oxy-propheniramine. Sweet. Pleasing taste. Some monsterism. Cool. You\\'re going to get an education. I\\'m going to teach you myself. Marge, it\\'s too late. The boy\\'s ten years old! Let\\'s focus our energy on Lisa and the other one. What\\'s your problem? Whacking Day is coming. Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year. But killing snakes is evil. Maybe so, Lisa, but it\\'s part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved. I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... Have a nice day at school, Lis. I\\'ll just try to make the best of a bad situation. Ahhh... Bart. Get dressed for school. I expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings. I bought a bell. I think I\\'ll unplug that. I\\'m your new teacher. My name is Mrs. Simpson. I didn\\'t do it. Oh, that\\'s right. I invited a guest speaker to talk to the class. Hello, children! I got separated from my platoon after we parachuted into Dusseldorf. So I rode out the war posing as a German cabaret singer. Ach du lieber! That is not ein a booby! Is that story true, Grampa? Well, most of it. I did wear a dress for a period in the forties. Oh, they had designers then... Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick. Whack! Oooh! Excuse me. Whack! Whack! Whack! Oooh! Oooooh! Oooooooh! Bart, I\\'d like you to read this copy of \"Johnny Tremain.\" It\\'s a book I read as a girl. A book? I think you might like this... It\\'s about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident... Deformed? Why didn\\'t you say so? They should call this book \"Johnny Deformed!\" \"Hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for: \\'A man can stand up...\\'\" Wow. Mm-hm, if you\\'d like to learn more about Colonial times we could take a field trip to Old Springfield Towne. Dad? Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it. Is there something wrong with me? Yes, honey. Then, what should I do? Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that? Yeah. Your Daddy hit the referee. Yeah. Yeah. Any experience? Thanks, Seymour. Yes I played Panicky Idiot #2 in \"The Poseidon Adventure.\" Sorry. We\\'re looking for more of a \"Duh, duh\" idiot. But... Oh, I see. Hello, Barney. Are you playing the town drunk? Actually, I\\'m supposed to be the governor. The enemy surrounded the fort and said that if the captain was sent out the rest would be spared. What did they do? They sent him out. Was he killed? And how! That\\'s why they call it Fort Sensible. This is Jebediah Springfield at the Battle of Ticonderoga. Next. And here he is killing a snake on the very first Whacking Day in 1775. Hey wait a minute. That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga. How could he be in two places at once? Um... Um... Y\\'see... He\\'ll blow the whole deal. Get him outta here. Roger. If you want to learn more about Whacking Day, there are many fine books in our gift shop. Welcome to your official Whacking Day Headquarters. I\\'ve hidden a snake somewhere in this store. The first one to whack it gets a free Squishee. Hey. Hey. Boy, I should have put more thought into my promotion. Aim for the body, men. Right chief. And the Lord said \"Whack ye all the serpents which crawl on their bellies and thy town shall be a beacon unto others.\" So you see, Lisa, even God himself endorses Whacking Day. Let me see that. No. OH WHACKING DAY / OH WHACKING DAY / OUR HALLOWED SNAKE SKULL CRACKING DAY... WE\\'LL BREAK THEIR BACKS / GOUGE OUT THEIR EYES / THEIR EVIL HEARTS WE\\'LL PULVERIZE... OH WHACKING DAY / OH WHACKING DAY / MAY GOD BESTOW HIS GRACE ON THEE. Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle. Woo hoo! Hooray! Take that, snake! And you, too! Snakes, snakes everywhere! You getting ready for Whacking Day? What\\'s Whacking Day? Did you bring the pre-whacked snakes? Beautiful. Well, Marge, should I whack slow or fast? Slow... then fast. Uh-oh. Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don\\'t lower yourself to the level of the mob. Lisa, maybe if I\\'m part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where\\'s my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn? And now, to open this year\\'s festivities, here\\'s our Grand Marshall, \"The Prophet of Love\"... Larry White! Barry White. No, it says here, Larry White. I know my own name. Yeah, well, we\\'ll see. Ladies and Gentlemen, my unlimited love to y\\'all. It\\'s truly an honor to be here at this... ... hey, what is this all about anyway? Oh God no! You people make me sick. Were they even listening to me? I uh, don\\'t think so. And now, let\\'s hear it for our own Miss Springfield! Gentlemen, start your whacking. Ew. A bug. If the snakes were in here we could protect them. Well, according to this, snakes \"hear\" by sensing vibrations in the ground. So, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes\\'ll be in here like Oprah on a baked ham. Oh, good idea! Let\\'s see... bass, bass... \"Tiny Tim\"... \"The Chipmunks Greatest Hits\"... \"A Castrato Christmas\"... ... CAN\\'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE... Mr. White, can we borrow you for a minute? Anything for a lady. Don\\'t bother the snakes. Leave all the snakes alone. Ah yeah. Oh babe... MY DARLING I... CAN\\'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE. GIRL I DON\\'T KNOW... I DON\\'T KNOW WHY... CAN\\'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE. / SOME THINGS I CAN\\'T GET USED TO / NO MATTER HOW I TRY / IT\\'S LIKE THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE I WANT / AND BABY THAT\\'S NO -- THAT\\'S NO LIE / TELL ME WHAT CAN I SAY / WHAT AM I GONNA DO? / HOW SHOULD I FEEL WHEN EVERYTHING... In here! Hey! Where\\'d all the snakes go? People of Springfield! Whacking Day is a sham! It was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish. \\'Tis true! I took many a lump, but \\'twas all in good fun. Now wait a minute. How can you people turn on snakes after all they\\'ve done for you? I\\'m an old man. I hate everything but Matlock. Ooh, it\\'s on now. Mrs. Glick, who killed all those rats in your basement? Snake did. And you like snakes, don\\'t you Barry White? I love the sexy slither of a lady snake. Oh baby. Hooray for snakes! Hooray for snakes! Look at this everyone! Twelve dead snakes! I\\'m sick of you people. You\\'re nothing but a pack of fickle mush heads. He\\'s right. Give us hell, Quimby. Bart, I\\'m very impressed at the independent learning you\\'ve displayed here. Yes. Anyway, as a reward for your studying, I\\'ve decided to welcome you back to our school. You\\'ll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, Dol... Oh dear God! I guess I\\'ve always used violence as a way of gettin\\' attention. Yes, yes, me too! Faster, Willie, faster! Now we give them the bikes, no one sues. What if they\\'re dead, sir? Then we ride these bikes to Mexico -- and freedom, Willie! Freedom! Freedom! . I\\'ll turn ya in at the first toll booth. Products you could only imagine before... the S.S. Microwave. Ah, my crepes are done. ... the Doggy Door Man... Good evening, Rex. ... the Mobilier the chandelier for your car! All on \"I Can\\'t Believe They Invented It!\" Hello everybody. I\\'m Troy McClure, star of such films as \"P is for `Psycho\\'\" and \"The President\\'s Neck Is Missing.\" But now I\\'m here to tell you about a remarkable new invention. Until now, this was the only way to get juice from an orange. You mean there\\'s a better way? But that\\'s all changed thanks to the \"Juice Loosener.\" Let\\'s meet the inventor, Doctor Nick Riviera. Hello, Troy. Hi everybody. Hi, Doctor Nick! Troy, would you like a glass of orange juice? I sure would. But won\\'t we have to pay those outrageous grocery store prices for something the farmer probably spit in? Not anymore. All, thanks to the new \"Juice Loosener.\" Doctor, are you sure it\\'s on? I can\\'t hear a thing. It\\'s whisper quiet. You got all that from one bag of oranges? That\\'s right. Order now and you\\'ll also get Sun `n\\' Run, the Suntan Lotion... that\\'s also a laxative! Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won\\'t get chest pain from answering the phone anymore. Please don\\'t tell the supervisor I have the flu. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ve been working with a shattered pelvis for three weeks. Oh my Juice Loosener\\'s never gonna come. Hey, dad. This came for you in the mail. Woo-Hoo! Mother, get an extra-special hug ready. I\\'ve bought you a new juicer! Good Lord! Flu germs entering every orifice in my head. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. What the? The dreaded Osaka flu has hit Springfield, with over 300 cases now reported. Now, over to Arnie Pie with \"Arnie in the Sky.\" Route 401 is going around and around, and around and around and around... And look out at the corner of 12th and Main because I\\'m gonna be sick. Whulp. Okay, Mr. Sun, gimme what ya got. Ninety-eight point six. You\\'re fine. Now, hurry up or you\\'ll miss your bus. Maybe you better take that temperature one more time. Sarge, we keep getting orders to let the virus win! Must be a school day. Lay down your arms. All right! Let\\'s make some pus. And now, for an emergency announcement from the mayor. People of Springfield, because of the epidemic, I have cancelled my vacation to the Bahamas. I shall not leave the city... Hey, you. Get that steel drum out of the, uh, Mayor\\'s office. Sorry, mon. Smithers, this plague doesn\\'t scare me. I\\'ve constructed a germ-free chamber for myself. Not a single microbe can get in or out. Who the devil are you? My name is Mr. Burns. We need a cure! We need a cure! Why, the only cure is bed rest. Anything I give you would only be a placebo. Where do we get these placebos? Maybe there\\'s some in this truck! I\\'m cured! I mean ouch! Dad! Todd\\'s speaking in tongues! I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the day, but I\\'m afraid he\\'s just delirious from fever. Oh, Neddie, why has God forsaken us? I can\\'t imagine what we could\\'ve done to... Oh... oh no! Peg, you gotta take better care of the house. These plants are all lifeless and limp! Maybe they\\'d feel more at home in the bedroom, Al! Uh oh. Oh...the network slogan is true. Watch Fox and be damned for all eternity. Mom, can you bring me more O.J.? Can you get me some of those Flintstones\\' chewable morphine? There is no such thing. Marge, the boy\\'s wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head. But, I\\'ll miss \"Sheriff Lobo.\" And get me a bottle of bourbon! Grampa, you know you can\\'t have liquids after three p.m. You can stir it into my mush. Either way, just gimme, gimme, gimme. Mom, I need more O.J. ... Flintstones\\' chewable morphine. I\\'ll miss Sheriff Lobo... Mom, I need more O.J. ... Flintstones\\' chewable morphine. I\\'ll miss Sheriff Lobo... O.J. Morphine Lobooo... O.J. Morphine Lobooo... And a bottle of aspirin, please. The aspirin is $24.95. $24.95! I lowered the price because an escaped mental patient tampered with the bottle. Oh dear, the alarm must be broken. If you could just move a bit to your left... Eight foot, six... Oh Sanjay, help Mrs. Simpson with her bag... and-while-you\\'re-at-it... Uske coat ke tharaf dekho. Haajee, Ekdam phataaphat. Mrs. Simpson! You did not pay for this bottle of Colonel Kwik-E-Mart\\'s Kentucky Bourbon. Uh... no, I-I guess I didn\\'t. All right. Come out with your hands up... two cups of coffee... an Auto Freshener that says \"Capricorn.\"... and something with coconut on it... Now, Marge, you\\'ve come to the right place. By hiring me as your lawyer, you also get this smoking monkey! Better cut down there, Smokey. Heh, heh. Mr. Hutz -- Look! He\\'s taking another puff! Release the dogs. Mr. Hutz! This was all a misunderstanding. I didn\\'t mean to take anything. Now don\\'t you worry Mrs. Simpson, I... uh-oh. We\\'ve drawn Judge Snyder. Is that bad? Well, he\\'s had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog. You did? Well, replace the word \"kinda\" with the word \"repeatedly,\" and the word \"dog\" with \"son.\" Look, Marge, I\\'ll just talk to Apu and I\\'m sure he\\'ll be reasonable. Apu, I\\'d like you to drop the charges against my wife. No offense, but we\\'re putting that bitch on ice. Now, come on! I\\'m your best customer. I\\'m sorry, Mr. Homer, but it is the policy of the Kwik-E-Mart and its parent corporation, NorDyne Defense Dynamics, to prosecute shoplifters to the full extent of the law. Don\\'t tell anyone, but Marge Simpson was arrested for shoplifting. Let the word go forth from this time and place: Marge Simpson is a shoplifter! Hey! In other news, the chick in \"The Crying Game\" is really a man. Boo! I mean, is that a good movie! Yay! ... And last Christmas, Marge made us gingerbread men, and there was a hair in one! Well I\\'ll let you in on a little secret about Marge Simpson... She\\'s got webbed toes. Puh-leeze. Now, Marge, don\\'t you worry. We\\'ve all had our brushes with the law. Are you Ed Flanders? No, Ned Flanders. My mistake. I\\'ll never have that problem again. Will you excuse me while I go and freshen up? I\\'ll follow her. Just wash your hands and get out. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, who do you find more attractive: Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson? What is the point of all this? Your honor, I feel so confident of Marge Simpson\\'s guilt, that I can waste the court\\'s time by rating the Super-Hunks. Wow! / She must be guilty. / Very impressive. / Ooh, he\\'s gonna win. Mr. Hutz! Now, Mrs. Lovejoy could you tell us a little about Marge Simpson? Well, as the wife of the minister, I\\'m privy to a lot of sensitive information. And here it is! Marge\\'s husband doesn\\'t earn much and the family\\'s a mess and, quite frankly, I think she... Let the record show that the witness made the \"drinky-drinky\" motion. And if we freeze on frame 138 , we distinctly see a puff of blue hair coming from the grassy knoll... Now, Apu, Mrs. Simpson claims that she forgot she was carrying that bottle of... Delicious... bourbon... brownest of the brown liquors... so tempting... What\\'s that? You want me to drink you? But I\\'m in the middle of a trial... Excuse me. Hello, David? I\\'m really tempted. Just take it one day at a time. And know that I love you. I love you too, man. So, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan, if that is your real name, have you ever forgotten anything? No. In fact I can recite pi to 40,000 places. The last digit is one! Mmm... pie. Well if you never forget anything, tell me this... What color tie am I wearing? You are wearing a red and white striped club tie, in a half Windsor knot. Oh, I am, am I? Is that what you think? Well, if that is what you think, I have something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows... I\\'m not wearing a tie at all. But, if I am wrong about that, maybe I am wrong about Mrs. Simpson. No further questions. Kids, I got a crazy feeling your mom\\'s not going to prison. Yay! You\\'re a latter-day Clarence Darrow. Uh, was he the black guy on the Mod Squad? Mr. Hutz when I grow up I want to be a lawyer just like you. Good for you, son. If there\\'s one thing American needs, it\\'s more lawyers. Can you imagine a world without lawyers? ... And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... I rest my case. Mr. Hutz, do you know you\\'re not wearing any pants? What? Your honor, I move for a \"bad court thingy.\" You mean a mistrial? Yeah. That\\'s why you\\'re the judge and I\\'m the law talking guy. The lawyer. Right. The foreman will pass the verdict to the Bailiff. This verdict is written on a cocktail napkin! ... And it still says \"guilty!\" ... And \"guilty\" is spelled wrong! Eep. Will the foreman please read the real verdict? We find the defendant, guilty! Marge Simpson, I sentence you to thirty days in prison. Next case. The National Council of Churches vs. Lionel Hutz. Oh right, that thing. You\\'re still my hero, Mom. Now you kids be good while mother\\'s in prison. Don\\'t worry, Mom. I\\'ll bust ya outta there just as soon as I get a cocktail dress and a crowbar. Bartina, until I met you, I was the loneliest warden in the penal system. Fresh! Down I go. I\\'ll be fine, dear. Marge, I\\'m gonna miss you so much. And it\\'s not just the sex... it\\'s also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I\\'ll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning. I\\'ll miss you too Homie. With her behind bars, our store is secure. I\\'m takin\\' this thing to Mexico. Knock, knock. I\\'m Marge Simpson. Your new cellmate. I\\'m Phillips. They call me that \\'cause I killed my husband with a Phillips-head screwdriver. It\\'s so nice not to have to cook. You mean your husband never cooked for you? Well... once. Homer, I don\\'t think this fish is quite dead yet. Marge, please. I\\'m having enough trouble with the lobsters. Oh my goodness. That\\'s Tattoo Annie. What kind of slime would I marry? I don\\'t understand. It\\'s one of those Mad Magazine fold-ins. Amazing! Now kids, while your mother\\'s gone, I don\\'t wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we\\'ll eat while standing over the sink or toilet. Who\\'s gonna change Maggie? We\\'re gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course. Excuse me, but I think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean. Dad! We\\'re running out of clean clothes! It seems like I\\'ve been wearing the same red dress forever. Go up to the attic. There\\'s a whole trunk of clothes up there. Alright! Bologna and cheese. What do you got, Bart? A pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared on a playing card. Haw, haw! Your mom\\'s a jailbird! So\\'s yours. Oh, yeah. Let\\'s play. Oh Mom, I\\'ve missed you so much. Oh honey, I\\'ve missed you too. Homer, is that an old Halloween costume? Uh... no. So how are things at home? We flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway and now we have to feed it. I\\'ll bet you want a piece of me. Well, you ain\\'t gonna get it, see! Ha, ha, ha... Doggone it. Honey, I don\\'t know what you\\'re feelin\\' right now. So I don\\'t wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk... Woo! Ooh! Do you have any of those delicious marshmallow squares? Sorry, Marge Simpson makes those. Oh darn. Fifteen dollars short. Exactly what Marge Simpson\\'s marshmallow squares bring in. Can we still afford that statue of Lincoln? No, I\\'m afraid we\\'ll have to go with something cheaper. I give you our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. Aw, C\\'mon. He\\'s history\\'s greatest monster. Gee, they look pretty mad. Yeah I\\'ve been starving \\'em... teasing \\'em... singin\\' off key... Me may ma moe... me moo ma may... me... This never would have happened if Marge Simpson was here. Goodbye, Marge. I\\'ll miss ya. I hope you find somebody. Men are such slime. But I\\'m seeing this new guy. I think he\\'s different. Yoo hoo! He says his name is Homer and he works at the nuclear plant. We\\'ve gotta clean this up before mom gets back. No problemo. We\\'ll just sweep it all under the rug. Hey, watch it! I didn\\'t expect all this. Well, we never should have let you go. From now on I\\'ll use my gossip for good instead of evil. Three cheers for Marge Simpson! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Now, Marge, we have a special treat for you. Uh, it\\'s beautiful. Live, from Springfield Harbor -- where the sewage meets the sand. It\\'s the Springfield Squares. Now Jacqueline, I believe it\\'s your turn. I will take Ranier Wolfcastle to block. Ah, Ranier Wolfcastle, star of McBain and the upcoming film, \"Help, My Son Is A Nerd!\" My son returns from a fancy east coast college and I\\'m horrified to find he\\'s a nerd. I\\'m laughing already. It\\'s not a comedy. Oh. Attention! This is the coast guard. A fifty foot tidal wave is heading this way. All game shows off the beach! Everybody up here to my square! It\\'s safe and it\\'s sexy. Oh baby. Hurry, Charley. There is not much time. I ain\\'t goin\\' nowhere. I been in this square pert near thirty seasons and I ain\\'t a-leavin\\' now. He\\'s dead now. Gabbo! Gabbo! Gabbo! Did you see that? Yeah. What\\'s Gabbo? I figure it\\'s some guy\\'s name. Some guy named Gabbo. I don\\'t think they\\'re giving you enough information, Dad. I\\'ll figure it out. I\\'m gonna use all the power of my brain. Look Smithers! Garbo is coming! Uh... yes sir. Everyone is saying \"Gabbo this\" and \"Gabbo that.\" But no one is saying \"Worship this\" and \"Jericho that.\" What\\'s this about Gabbo? I can\\'t believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo! He\\'ll tell us what to do. Hello. I\\'m Gabbo. And I\\'m Arthur Crandall. That\\'s easy for you to say. You don\\'t have a hand up your tuchus. Oh, Gabbo. You\\'ll say anything. And you can watch us every afternoon at four. That\\'s the same time as Krusty the Klown! Uh-oh. That cute little character could take America by storm. All he needs is a hook. I\\'m a bad widdle boy. Ay carumba! YOU\\'RE GONNA LIKE ME / YOU\\'RE GONNA LOVE ME / \\'CAUSE I CAN DO MOST ANYTHING... ... I CAN DO THE \"HULLY GULLY\"/ I CAN IMITATE VIN SCULLY... Let\\'s take time out from this triple play to talk about Farmer Dan\\'s pure pork sausages. Mmmmm! ... I\\'LL GIVE OUT SHINY DIMES... I\\'LL TRAVEL BACK IN TIME... YOU\\'RE GONNA LIKE HIM! YOU\\'RE GONNA LOVE HIM! IT\\'S THE GREATEST SHOW IN TOWNNNNN! Gabbo! Eh, that dummy doesn\\'t scare me. I\\'ve had plenty of guys come after me and I\\'ve buried \\'em all. Hobos, sea captains, Joey Bishop... Don\\'t forget the Special Olympics. Oh, yeah. I slaughtered the Special Olympics. Are those our ratings? Let me see. I lost to Channel Ocho? What the Hell is that? Dos huevos, por favor. Que Lastima. I gotta steal that bit. This is boring. NELSON I wonder what would happen if you put your train on there. Cool. Now, let\\'s throw some crud on it! Hey, it\\'s four o\\'clock. So you want ventriloquism, do ya? All right. Watch this. Hello Alphonse, I\\'ve got a riddle for you. Why is a raven like a writing desk? I don\\'t know. Why is a... Hey, the dummy can\\'t hurt you. He\\'s not even alive. He\\'s dead! All right, here\\'s the deal. Every time you watch my show, I will send you $40. Checks will not be honored. I admit I have used the city treasury to fund the murder of my enemy. But as Gabbo would say, \"I\\'m a bad widdle boy.\" Well kids, this is where you would watch Itchy and Scratchy, except they\\'re on the Gabbo show now. So, here\\'s Eastern Europe\\'s favorite cat and mouse team: Worker and Parasite! What the hell was that? Whoa! Me rikey velly much. Oh, I hope I didn\\'t offend you. I need this bad. WITH MY... Well, that\\'s it. We\\'ve been canceled. I think we can be proud that we never did a bad show... except for that week Ray Jay Johnson was my co-host. \"You can call me Ray... and you can call me Jay...\" That thing was funny for about three seconds. But the important thing is, we\\'re like a family. Krusty, I... Shut your hole. Krusty, how ya holding up? I\\'m kinda worried about the future. How do you deal with it? Well, you\\'ve been on TV longer than I have. I\\'m sure you\\'ve saved up quite a nest egg. Uh-yeah. Do they still buy human hair down at the wig shop? Krusty, you wanna stay for dinner? Nah, sorry. Ah, that\\'s too bad. Tonight my guests will be Dr. Carl Sagan and from the San Diego Zoo, Joan Embrey. Oh Kyle, I just don\\'t think I fit in here at Melrose Place. From now on, I\\'ll be doing the thinking for both of us. Next. Come on! You stupid horse! I got my last ten bucks on you! No, don\\'t look at me! Run! No! Don\\'t come over here! Oh boy. And now, it\\'s time for another patented Gabbo Crank Call! Oh I love these. I can\\'t believe it. He stole this bit from Krusty! Yeah, well Krusty stole it from Steve Allen. Oh, everything\\'s stolen nowadays. Why the fax machine is nothing but a waffle iron with a phone attached. It\\'s ringing. Hello. Is this Krusty the Klown? Is this the callback for that porno film? Look, I was a little nervous that day. But I\\'m all man, I can assure you... No, I represent a Japanese camera company. We\\'d like to pay you two million dollars to do a camera commercial. Bad enough to hit yourself over the head with the phone? Oh, you got it. Ow. Ow. Ew, blood. What the? If this is anyone but Steve Allen, you\\'re stealing my bit. Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo\\'s career the way he ruined Krusty\\'s. Two wrongs don\\'t make a right, Bart. Yes they do. No they don\\'t. Yes they do. No they don\\'t. Yes they do. Dad... Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues. We\\'ll be back after this commercial for Gabbo Airlines. That ought to hold the little S.O.B.\\'s. Gabbo, quiet. Oh, I wouldn\\'t want to offend the little S.O.B.\\'s. I wish you\\'d stop saying that. Hmmm. Hey, boyo, what\\'s so funny? Well, it\\'s... Ah, you wouldn\\'t be interested. It\\'s too low brow. No I\\'m quite low brow. Well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men\\'s room wall. This I gotta see! All the kids in Springfield are S.O.B.\\'s. ... Gabbo\\'s kind of language has no place on or off TV. And that\\'s my two cents. Well, that ought to hold those S.O.B.\\'s. What the...? Oh no! Krusty, are you making any money? Nah. That guy is giving it away for free. THE OLD GREY MARE / SHE AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... Desalinization plant? Thirty-five years in show business and already no one remembers me. Just like what\\'s his name... and whosis... and you know, that guy, always wore a shirt... Ed Sullivan? Yeah. I didn\\'t know you knew Luke Perry! Know him? He\\'s my worthless half brother. He\\'s a big TV star. Yeah, on Fox... Elizabeth Taylor... Bette Midler... Bette and I owned a race horse together. Krudler. Hey Bart, If we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with Krusty, it might get his career going again. Here\\'s my address book. Go get those stars! It won\\'t be easy, but I\\'m gonna claw my way back onto TV. THE OLD GRAY MARE/ SHE AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE/ AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE/ AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... And now, the crazy old man singers. THE OLD GRAY MARE / SHE AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE / AIN\\'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE... Miss Midler, I can\\'t believe you do this all by yourself. We\\'re Americans. We deserve clean highways. You pigs! Oh nooo! Bette Midler. Now where were we? We were asking you to appear on Krusty\\'s come back special. Okay. Tell Krusty he can count me in. It\\'s time to take out the trash. I\\'ll get you for this, Midler... And off to your left is Hugh Hefner\\'s Shelbyville Pad. A lot of people know about the grotto and the game room... Of course. But few know about the laboratory, the biosphere, the alternative energy research center... Fascinating. Yes. The grotto uses so much water... the bunnies felt we should go this way. Smart bunnies, Hef. I can call you Hef, can\\'t I? No. You told our agent this place holds thirty-thousand people. It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin\\' restless. We want Chilly Willy! We want Chilly Willy! Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Would you guys like to appear on a Krusty the Klown Special? Sure -- if you get us out of this gig. No problemo. Hey, Moe! Look over there. What?... What am I lookin\\' at? I don\\'t see nothin\\'. I\\'m gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it? Hey, Moe, can I look too? Sure, but it\\'ll cost ya. My wallet\\'s in the car. He is so stupid. And now, back to the wall... Ms. Taylor, a couple of grade school kids wanted you to be on a Krusty special. I told them to buzz off. Good. Krusty! We\\'ve got great news! Krusty! What have you done to yourself? I thought I\\'d get into shape so I\\'ve been drinking nothing but milkshakes. You mean those diet milkshakes? Uh-oh. Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out. Oh, wait. That was the old sofa. I\\'ll never get my aim back. You\\'ve got to keep working on it. Ooh, delicious. Oh, why am I bothering? It\\'s hopeless. Hi kids! It\\'s me, Gabbo! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ho! Pork prices rose in early trading today. But you\\'ve gotta come back, Mel! We\\'re a team. No, Krusty. You always treated me rather shabbily. On our last show you poured liquid nitrogen down my pants and cracked my buttocks with a hammer. Ah, come on, you wanna waste your life hanging out with a bunch of dorky teenagers? Here\\'s your taco, Mister. Oops. It fell in the fryer. I\\'ll get it out. Sorry, Krusty. I like it here. Mr. Johannson treats me with dignity. Is this clown bothering you, Mel? That\\'s all right, Mr. Johannson. I\\'ll handle it. Here\\'s your taco, sir. I don\\'t want it. But this comes out of my salary. If I had a girlfriend, she\\'d kill me. Ok Krusty, let\\'s rehearse the balloon bit. Look, kids. A horsie! And what are you making Sideshow Luke Perry? A 19th Century carousel. Upstage me, will ya! Get the hell out! Look, there must be something I can do on the show. Please. For Mom\\'s sake. Well... maybe we can find something. I don\\'t like it. He\\'s got Johnny Carson, Bette Midler AND Hugh Hefner. What do we got? Ray Jay Johnson. Now boys... uh... the network has a problem with some of your lyrics. Would you mind changing \\'em for the show? Forget you, clown. Hey, our lyrics are like our children, man. No way. Here\\'s that ruby-studded clown nose you ordered, Krusty. Well okay. But here where you say \"What I got you gotta get and put it in you,\" how about just \"what I\\'d like is I\\'d like to hug and kiss you\"? Wow, that\\'s much better. Everyone can enjoy that. Live from Springfield, the entertainment capital of this state, the Krusty Comeback Special. SEND IN THE CLOWNS / THOSE DAFFY, LAFFY CLOWNS / SEND IN THOSE SOULFUL AND DOLEFUL, SHMOTZ-BY-THE BOWLFUL CLOWNS... / SEND IN THE CLOWNS THEY\\'RE ALREADY HERE... I love you Krusty. Quiet Are you comfortable in there, Luke Perry? Fire away, Krusty. My face! My valuable face! Dancing around in their underwear. That is so degrading. Thirty seconds till your L\\'il Stinker sketch. Get me a bigger lolly. Now, Johnny, whatcha got for us. Jokes -- a little magic? Actually I thought I\\'d lift this 1987 Buick Skylark over my head. Hi yo! Johnny, that\\'s amazing! Oh yeah? Get a load of this. I\\'ve got to fire that agent. DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU\\'RE MY HERO? YOU\\'RE EVERYTHING I WOULD LIKE TO BE? YOU CAN FLY HIGHER THAN AN EAGLE... \\'CAUSE YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS. This was a great show, Krusty. You deserve an Emmy for this. Forget it. The Academy hates me. I don\\'t know why. Bunch of old, know-nothin\\' dinosaurs wouldn\\'t know entertainment if it bit \\'em in the Hey hey! Now, Krusty, I just hope you remembered to save your money this time. Hey you can\\'t come in here dressed like that. Get with the times, Moe. Yeah. I say, if it feels good, do it. All right. Don\\'t snap my undies. I\\'m a star again. I don\\'t know how to thank you kids. That\\'s alright, Krusty. We\\'re getting 50% of the T-shirt sales. What!? That\\'s the sweetest plum. You... little... Ahh. What the Hell. You deserve it. Thanks kids. To Krusty. The greatest entertainer in the world. Except maybe that guy. Is this the bus to the Civic Center? Human roaches. Feeding off each other\\'s garbage. The only thing you can\\'t buy here is dignity. Welcome swappers to the Springfield Swap meet. Ich Bin Eine Springfield Swap Meet Patron! I need a drink and a shower. Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You\\'ll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!! Oh boy! Free trading cards! Wow, Joseph of Aramathia! Twenty-six conversions in A.D. 46! Whoa, a Methuselah rookie card! Well, boys, who\\'d have thought learning about religion could be fun? Religion? Learning? Let\\'s get outta here! Hey! Wow an original Malibu Stacey from 1958. Oooh. Yeah. They took her off the market after some kid put both his eyes out. Oh my. \"Prisoner 24601\"... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I\\'d see the old girl again. Still fits. Small world. It is, it really really is. Ooh, five cents each! Junk... junk... the airplane\\'s upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?... Your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really \"cool.\" I doubt my son or daughter is that stupid. What the hell is this? Melvin and the Squirrels. Part of the rodent invasion of the early 60s. STUCK A FEATHER IN HIS CAP AND CALLED IT... RICE-A-RONI! Mel-vin! Bart, look! It\\'s Dad! Dad, when did you record an album? I\\'m surprised you don\\'t remember, son. It was only eight years ago. Dad, thanks to television, I can\\'t remember what happened eight minutes ago. No, really, I can\\'t. It\\'s a serious problem. What are we all laughing about? Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left \"Saturday Night Live\" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet... Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... HELLO, MA BABY / HELLO, MA HONEY / HELLO, MA RAGTIME, RAGTIME GAL / SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... ETC. Every afternoon at Moe\\'s, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild. Yoo hoo! Barbershop! That ain\\'t been popular since aught six, dagnabit! Bart, what did I tell you? No talking like a grizzled 1890\\'s prospector... consarnit! BA-BY ON BOARD. Rock \\'n\\' roll had become stagnant. \"Achy Breaky Heart\" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE... GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABY. That\\'s my son up there. What, the balding fat-ass? No, the Hindu guy. NEVER TO SEE YOU ANY... NEVER GONNA SEE YOU ANY... I\\'m gonna nail that cop right between the eyes. Right after this song is over. GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABE. GOODBYE, MY CONEY ISLAND BABY / FAREWELL, MY OWN TRUE LOVE... Ching, ching. You know, Reverend, this really isn\\'t a hymn. Ned, there\\'s an oil stain in the parking lot that looks just like St. Barnabus. Oh my stars! SO GOODBYE... FAREWELL... SHOP KWIK-E-MART AND SAVE... GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE / GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE / GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLAND BABE! Homer, I\\'m a theatrical agent, and I want to represent your group. Really? Yeah! You\\'ve got... it! All except that police officer. Too Village People. You\\'ll have to replace him. Just leave it to me. Where are we going? Where are we going? Run along, boy. You\\'re free now! No! Nooo! Nooo! Principal Seymour Skinner. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. Principal Skinner... Never fit on a marquee, luv. From now on, your name is Apu Du Beaumarchais. It is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my God, but okay. The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum\\'s replacement... OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM / EE-I-EE-I-O / AND ON THIS FARM HE HAD A CHICK / SWINGINGEST CHICK I KNOW / WITH A WIGGLE WIGGLE HERE AND A WIGGLE WIGGLE THERE... Get off the stage!

ME MITHER SANG THIS SONG TO ME / IN TONES SO SOFT AND ... Barney! JUST A LITTLE IRISH DITTY... Barney, how\\'d you like to sing for our group? Sure, why not? Now where\\'s me toothpick. TURA LURA LURA -- TURA LURA LI -- WIGGUM FOREVER, BARNEY NEVER! WIGGUM FOREVER, BARNEY NEVER!... SWE-EE-EE-EE-EET ADELEINE. SWEET ADELEINE. MY-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y ADELEINE. MY ADELEINE.... Mm hmm? BARNEY FOREVER, WIGGUM NEVER! BARNEY FOREVER, WIGGUM NEVER!... Hey, those girls you paid to scream are doing a great job. I didn\\'t pay any girls to scream. Hanh?!!! Look at this. / We sounded great, huh? / Etc. Only one question remains gentlemen. What do we call ourselves? How about Handsome Homer Simpson Plus Three? I like it. We need a name that\\'s witty at first, but that seems less funny each time you hear it. How about The Be Sharps! Perfect. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. The Be Sharps. well, can\\'t blame a guy for trying. Aw, you\\'re all under arrest. What\\'d you kids get? I bought this cool pencil holder. Far out, man. I haven\\'t seen a bong in years. No one bought a wishbone necklace. Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire. It\\'ll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don\\'t I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980\\'s... THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE\\'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN\\'T GERALDO\\'S FAULT -- Look what I got. Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car. Hmm... baby on board. BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself! ... I\\'M TELLING YOU, IT\\'S MIGHTY NICE / EACH TRIP\\'S A TRIP TO PARADISE... Yeah! Gentlemen, you\\'ve just recorded your first number one. Wait\\'ll I tell Marge! Oh yes, Bouffant Betty. Well I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. You see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can. Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I\\'m sure she\\'ll understand. Come on, honey. It\\'ll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden. BABY ON BOARD / HOW I\\'VE ADORED / THAT SIGN ON MY CAR\\'S WINDOWPANE... That\\'s my boy Homer singing! Paul Harvey\\'s on. ... and that little boy who nobody liked grew up to be... Roy Cohn. Wow! And now you know the rest of the story. BOUNCE IN MY STEP... LOADED WITH PEP... \\'CAUSE I\\'M DRIVING THE CARPOOL LANE... Ah, squiddy. I got nothing against ya. I just heard there was gold in your belly. ... WITH MY BA-BY ON BOARD. Homer, you\\'re going to be famous! Yeah, but I\\'m not gonna let it change our lives. I\\'ll be the same loving father I\\'ve always been. Have you seen Bart? I stuck him somewhere. Look what I got for you, Dad. Oh, Hom... gimme the keys. I have a question for Apu du Beaumarchais. Isn\\'t it true that you\\'re really an Indian? By the many arms of Vishnu, I swear it is a lie. Barney, how did you join the group? They found me on the men\\'s room floor. You\\'ve been referred to as \"The Funny One.\" Is that reputation justified? Yes. Yes it is. GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE -- GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLE -- GOODBYE MY CONEY ISLAND BABE! Damned ceremonies. This is time I could be working, Mommy. We\\'d like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She\\'s 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons. This enormous woman will devour us all! I meant the statue. Okay...Gilligan, the Skipper and Chief Wiggum. Name three castaways. Hi-yo! Clancy, use the remote. Oh yeah. Can we talk about Chief Wiggum? We had fame and fortune. Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes. And the Grammy for Outstanding Soul, Spoken word, or Barbershop Album of the Year, goes to...The Be Sharps! Congratulations! David Crosby, you\\'re my hero! You like my music? You\\'re a musician? Then came the greatest thrill of my life. Hello, Homer. I\\'m George Harrison. Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie? Over there. There\\'s a big pile of \\'em. Oh man. Well, what a nice fellow. Lisa, did you see the Grammys? You beat Dexy\\'s Midnight Runners! Well, you haven\\'t heard the last of them. Miss you, Daddy. I miss you too, honey. Here\\'s the champagne you ordered, Mr. Simpson. Oh. Thanks. Here. Wow! An award statue! Oh. It\\'s a Grammy. Hey! Don\\'t throw your garbage down here. Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam... They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you\\'re dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart! What? I can\\'t believe you\\'re not still popular. What\\'d you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus? All the time. It was the title of our second album! But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down. What about Bob Hope? He\\'s been consistently popular for over 50 years. So has Sinatra. Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of-- Dean Martin still packs \\'em in. Ditto Tom Jones. Shut up! With your father on the road all the time I tried to compensate for his absence... Hi, kids... I love Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own... FOR ALL THE LATEST MEDICAL POOP / CALL SURGEON GENERAL, C. EVERETT KOOP / KOOP KOOP ADOOP This is worse than your song about Mr. T. I pity the fool who doesn\\'t like... he. And wher\\'s Barney? Oh, he\\'s with his new girlfriend. The Japanese conceptual artist. Barbershop is in danger of growing stale. I\\'m taking it to strange new places. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Number 8. Then came the day we knew we were finished. Gentlemen, US Magazine just came out with its \"What\\'s Hot and What\\'s Not Issue.\" Are we hot? We are not. We all went our separate ways. Well William, I\\'m back. So, how did you spend your summer? I made millions in software and lost it at the track. Ach! It may not be glamorous, but it\\'s good honest work. How much is this quart of milk? Twelve dollars. Hey, Barney, what\\'ll it be? I\\'d like a beer Moe. I\\'d like a single plum floating in perfume, served in a man\\'s hat. Here you go. Hey, fellas! I\\'m back. Ah that\\'s great. Your replacement was getting tired. Hey, Queenie, you can go now. I\\'ll give her a good home. And I did. I\\'ll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top. Man, that\\'s some story. But there are still a few things I don\\'t get. Like how come we never heard about this until today? Yeah, and what happened to the money you made? Why haven\\'t you hung up your gold record? Since when could you write a song? There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they\\'ll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed. I can\\'t remember the last time we were all together. Last year on that stupid Dame Edna special. And a one and a two and a three... Ba bum bum bum... BABY ON BOARD / HOW I\\'VE ADORED / THAT SIGN ON MY CAR\\'S WINDOWPANE... Hello... Human Fly here... C\\'mon. I stayed up all night dying my underwear. Extra, extra! Be Sharps sing on rooftop! What? Gimme one of those! Wait a minute! There\\'s nothing in here about the Be Sharps. Come back here! Haw haw! It\\'s been done. Pretty, eh, Chief? It sure is, Lou... It sure is. Get the tear gas. ... IT\\'S A TRIP TO PARADISE / WITH MY BA-BY... ON BOARD! I\\'d like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition. I don\\'t get it. Ladies and gentlemen, it\\'s \"Up Late with McBain,\" I\\'m your announcer, Ubergruppenfuher Wolfcastle. And, heeeeere\\'s McBain. This is horrible. The Fox network has sunk to a new low. Lisa, you got a letter. It\\'s from my pen pal, Anya! Dear Lisa. As I write this I am very sad. Our president has been overthrown and... ... replaced by the benevolent General Krull. All hail Krull and his glorious new regime. Sincerely, Little Girl. You got a letter too, Bart. I\\'m going to kill you. Bart, what\\'s wrong with you? Oh my god, someone\\'s trying to kill me! Oh wait, it\\'s for Bart. Hmm. This one\\'s done in different handwriting. Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt. Haw haw! But who\\'d want to hurt me? I\\'m this century\\'s \"Dennis the Menace.\" It\\'s probably the person you least suspect! That\\'s good, Dad. I say we call Matlock. He\\'ll find the culprit. It\\'s probably that evil Gavin McCloud or George \"Goober\" Lindsey. Grampa, Matlock\\'s not real. Neither are my teeth, but I can still eat corn on the cob if someone cuts it off and smushes it into a fine paste. Now that\\'s good eating. I checked around. The girls are calling you \"fatty fat fat fat\", and Nelson\\'s planning to pull down your pants, but nobody\\'s trying to kill you. That\\'s good. Fatty fat fat fat! Fatty fatty fat fat! All right, this is dedicated to Bart Simpson with the message, \"I am coming to kill you, slowly and painfully.\" Bart, I\\'m going to get you... ... some ice cream at the store, since I\\'m saving so much money on diet cola. Say your prayers, Simpson... ... \\'cause the schools can\\'t force you like they should. Maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church. Yeah! You\\'re going to be my murder victim, Bart... ... in our school production of \"Lizzie Borden,\" starring Martin Prince as Lizzie! Fourty whacks with a wet noodle, Bart! I\\'d like to help you, ma\\'am, but I\\'m afraid there\\'s no law against mailing threatening letters. I\\'m pretty sure there is. Hrrmph. The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle-- Hey, she\\'s right, chief. Well, shut my mouth. It\\'s also illegal to put squirrels down your pants for the purposes of gambling. Boys, knock it off. Bart, I figured it out. Who\\'s someone you\\'ve been making irritating phone calls to for years? Linda Lavin? No, someone who didn\\'t deserve it. Hello Moe? We know you\\'re the one behind this. So knock it off or we\\'re going to the cops. No no, I\\'ll take care of it. Okay it\\'s over! Get \\'em out of here! All right, andalay! Andalay! You\\'re out there somewhere. But where? Where? Dear Life in these United States. A funny thing happened to me... Use a pen, Sideshow Bob. Parole granted! Next up for parole, Bob Terwilliger, aka Sideshow Bob. Take care, Snake. May the next time we meet be under more felicitous circumstances. Guh? Take care. Buh. Sideshow Bob has no decency. He called me Chief Piggum! Oh, now I get it. Sideshow Bob tried to kill me on our honeymoon! Murmur!... Murmur!... Murmur! How many people in this court are thinking of killing her right now? Be honest. Ah, she\\'s always leaving the toilet seat up. Robert, if released, would you pose any threat to one Bart Simpson? Bart Simpson? The spirited little scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and sent me to this dank, urine-soaked hell-hole? Uh... we object to the term, \"urine-soaked hell-hole\" when you could have said, \"peepee-soaked heck-hole.\" Cheerfully withdrawn. What about that tattoo on your chest. Doesn\\'t it say \"Die Bart, Die?\" No... That\\'s German for \"The Bart, The.\" Oh. / How continental. / Etc. No one who speaks German could be an evil man. Parole granted. Wow, the pooblic libary. Let\\'s stay here for a while, Vern. That man is so rude. Yeah. If you don\\'t mind, we\\'re trying to watch the mov... Hey, Vern, help me get my get head out of this toilet. Oh really, now. That\\'s too much. Sideshow Bob! You wrote me those letters. You awful man. Stay away from my son. Oh I\\'ll stay away from your son, all right. Stay away, forever. Oh no! Wait a minute. That\\'s no good. No! Wait. I\\'ve got a good one now. Marge, say, \"Stay away from my son\" again. No! And turn! And flex! And shake! And bounce! And turn! And flex! And shake! And bounce! Now Sideshow Bob can\\'t get in without me knowing. And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal. Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won\\'t you join me in my kitchen? It doesn\\'t work if you invite him. Hiedilly-hey! Go home. Toodledy-doo! Now don\\'t you fret. When I\\'m through, he won\\'t set foot in this town again. I can be very, very persuasive. Come on! Leave town! No. I\\'ll be your friend. No. You\\'re mean. The following neighborhood residents will not be killed by me. Ned Flanders, Maude Flanders... Isn\\'t that nice? ... Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson, Lisa Simpson, that little baby Simpson. That is all. Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh. Don\\'t worry, Mrs. Simpson, we\\'ve helped hundreds of people in danger. We\\'ll give you a new name, a new job, new identities. Ooh! I wanna be John Elway. Elway takes the snap and runs it in for a touchdown! Woo hoo! Whup, two against one! I don\\'t think this is such a good idea. This isn\\'t just because of Sideshow Bob. It\\'s a chance to turn around all our stinking lives. I\\'ll be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah! Shut up, boy. We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville... Ooh, Ice Creamville. No. Screamville. Tell you what sir, from now on you\\'ll be Homer Thompson at Terror Lake. Let\\'s just practice a bit. When I say \"Hello, Mr. Thompson,\" you\\'ll say, \"Hi.\" Check. Hello, Mr. Thompson. Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson. I got ya. Hello, Mr. Thompson. Now when I say, \"Hello, Mr. Thompson\" and press down on your foot... you smile and nod. No problem. Hello, Mr. Thompson. I think he\\'s talking to you. Here you go. Oh, what a cute convertible. You guys at the bureau thought of everything. Hey look! \"The FBI Light Opera Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan.\" THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL ARE WE / PERT AS A SCHOOLGIRL WELL CAN BE / FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH GIRLISH GLEE / THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL... EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA. Lousy speed bumps. Ew. This coffee\\'s too hot. Hey, kids! Wanna drive through that cactus patch? Ow! / Oh! / Etc. The Thompsons! Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don\\'t like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else. Homer, where\\'s the dog? I tied him up, out back. We\\'ve left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life? Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left. Hello? Hel-lo? You have my pills! Hel-lo? I\\'m cold and there are wolves after me. Hello, Bart. Down here, Bart. What do you want? Surely there\\'s no harm in laying in the middle of a public street. Not the elephants! Aaah... Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me! Bart! Don\\'t interrupt! Homer, this is serious. Oh it is not. Roman numeral three, surprise boy in bed... and a... disembowel him. No, I don\\'t like that \"bowel\" in there. \"Gut him.\" Ahh... Le mot juste. BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?! C\\'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they\\'re still hot. Dad, I\\'m kinda edgy right now. I\\'d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife. Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy. Nope. BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK? Sorry. What am I thinking? Hello, Bart. Mom! Dad! Your family can\\'t help you now. Oh, no! Dad\\'s been drugged! No, he hasn\\'t. Uh-oh. Oh, yeah. Well, Bart. Any last requests? Well, there is one, but... Nah. No, go on. Well, you have such a beautiful voice... Guilty as charged. Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of \"The HMS Pinafore\"? Very well, Bart. I shall send you to heaven before I send you to hell. And a two and a three and... WE SAIL THE OCEAN BLUE / AND OUR SAUCY SHIP\\'S A BEAUTY / WE ARE SOBER MEN AND TRUE / AND ATTENTIVE TO OUR DUTY... I\\'M CALLED LITTLE BUTTERCUP / POOR LITTLE BUTTERCUP / THOUGH I COULD NEVER TELL WHY... WHAT NEVER? / NO NEVER / WHAT NEVER?... HARDLY EVER! HE\\'S HARDLY EVER SICK AT SEA! FOR HE HIMSELF HAS SAID IT / AND IT\\'S CLEARLY TO HIS CREDIT / THAT HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN / HE REMAINS AN E-E-E-E-NGLISHMAN! And now, the final curtain. Hold it right there, Sideshow Bob. You\\'re under arrest. By Lucifer\\'s Beard! Uh, yeah. It\\'s a good thing you drifted by this brothel. I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from \"The HMS Pinafore.\" Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies. Take him away, boys. Aw, no fair. Hey, I\\'m the Chief here. Bake him away, toys. What\\'d you say, Chief? Do what the kid says. It\\'s so good to be home again. Look what happened without my pills. Bart, run upstairs and get Grampa\\'s medicine! Not so fast. I wanna court this fair young maiden. There\\'s something you should know about me. I\\'ve got Steve and Edie tickets. I\\'m all yours. Core meltdown in ten seconds... nine... eight. Meltdown averted. Good boy. Huh? What? How dare you disturb me during nap time! We\\'re from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This is a surprise test of worker competence. There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns\\' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy... Get the axe. The watchdog of public safety. Is there any lower form of life? Don\\'t worry, sir. I rounded up our less gifted employees and led them into the basement. Duh, Homer, why are we down here? Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee. But why? You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy. Duh, it\\'s gettin\\' away... Oh! We did bad! Is there a Homer Simpson present? I\\'m afraid he couldn\\'t bee here. Yes, he\\'s in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick. The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom\\'s big! Oh! Homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. Now, we\\'re going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight. What the hell are you talking about? What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you\\'ve got to tell me! Relax, it\\'s just a simulator. Nothing can go wrong. Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go. No, this can\\'t be happening! For the love of god, sir, there are two seats... I like to put my feet up. Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time. We\\'re still not sure how he caused the meltdown. There wasn\\'t any nuclear material in the truck. Oh, very well, it\\'s time for your bribe. Now you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing... Or you can trade it all in for what\\'s in this box. The box! The box! Look, Burns, this is a big problem. You can\\'t just throw money at it and make it go away. Gentlemen, I\\'ve decided there will be no investigation. Now if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ll go away. You\\'re in big trouble, Burns. Homer Simpson\\'s job requires college training in Nuclear Physics. Now you get your man up to speed or we\\'ll be forced to take legal action. Is that so? Well I have the feeling you\\'ll be \"dropping\" the charges... The painters moved your desk, sir. Oh, yes. Hello, Simpson. My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and thought we\\'d stop by. Uh... excuse me, what are you doing? Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares? Yes. He would. So you want me to go to college? College? Barber or clown? Bart! Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101. Oh, and one more thing. You must find the jade monkey before the next full moon. Actually, sir, we found the jade monkey. It was in your glove compartment. And the road maps and ice scraper? They were in there too, sir. Excellent. It\\'s all falling into place. I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much. Maybe you\\'re right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way. Homer, sign this application and you\\'re a shoe-in. That dog has somebody\\'s ham! This I gotta see! C\\'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C\\'mon! Gimme\\' that! Dad, don\\'t let these application essays throw you. Let\\'s see... \"List your three favorite books and how they\\'ve influenced your life.\" Is \"TV Guide\" a book? No. Son of Sniglets?? No. Katharine Hepburn\\'s \"Me\"? No. I suck. ... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever. You the man, Homer. Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch... I dunno, Dad. Don\\'t you have a better picture? Relax, a photo can\\'t make any difference. He looks crazy. Agreed. Reading his essay would only waste valuable seconds. Finally, the great taste of Worchestershire sauce... in a soft drink! Ah... steakey. Sorry, son, but there\\'s a program about campus life that I really should watch. We now return to \"School of Hard Knockers\" starring Corey Masterson. Dean Bitterman, I hope nothing unsavory happens during my visit. As you know, I am the President of the United States. Oh, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve expelled those rowdy members of Chug-a-lug House. I hate that lousy dean! Your bra-bomb better work, Nerdlinger. Corey! Don\\'t worry, Mr. President, I... Mr. President!? Lighten up, Bitterman. That youngster will make a perfect addition to my cabinet... Secretary of Partying Down! G-rrrrr! Yes! Take that, Bitterman! Homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to. Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store! Well, Pop, what are you gonna do? Something I should have done a long time ago... You don\\'t know, do you? No, ma\\'am. Don\\'t worry, Simpson, it just so happens I have a chair at Springfield University... I\\'m sorry, Mr. Burns, but I must object. This \"Simpson\" is not qualified. I see. Well, you know, fellas, I look at the admissions board a lot like a baseball team. You all like baseball, don\\'t you? Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork. Not some hot dog admissions officer playing by his own rules. I\\'m giving you the beating of your life! Look, if - stop that. If you wanted him in that badly, why didn\\'t you just say so? Smithers, dismember the corpse and send his widow a corsage. Woo hoo, I\\'m a college man! I won\\'t need my high school diploma anymore. I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T. My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this. Hey! How long have you been back there? Three days. Nerd! Homer, that isn\\'t very nice. Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time. Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd? Pardon me? I\\'ll be a campus hero... Attention everyone! The punch has been spiked! Don\\'t worry, your parents have been called and will be here to pick you up shortly. Marge, someone\\'s squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it\\'s a crusty, bitter, old dean! Hi there, hello, I\\'m Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby. I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, I\\'m always up for some Hackey Sack. Or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass player for \"The Pretenders.\" Boy, I can\\'t wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt. Good morning and welcome to Nuclear Physics 101. I see a lot of new faces, but you know the old saying, \"Out with the old, in with the nucleus!\" Hold me. Now, we\\'ll begin by - oops... You see that, sir. Drops his notes. Now, if anyone would like to stay, I\\'m going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class. Do we have to? No. Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye! Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase. Yeah, but this is what they\\'re doing on campus. Besides, it isn\\'t costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site. Sir, six cinderblocks are missing. There\\'ll be no hospital then. I\\'ll tell the children. This proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it... Uh, excuse me \"Professor Brainiac,\" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works. Well please, come down and show us. All right, I will. In there, guys. Thanks, Homer. Homer, no one blames you for the accident. We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. I researched these names myself... Yeah, you\\'ve won this round, Dean. But the war isn\\'t over. Hello? Hello, Dean? You\\'re a stupid head. Homer, is that you? Hiya, gang! Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert! Stop the Humanoid! Look, I\\'m supposed to get a physics tutor... Well, you\\'ve come to the right place then. If there\\'s one thing we know, it is science... And math... Do as I say! And the words to every Monty Python routine... We are the Knights who say Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee! Heh heh. \"Nee.\" We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf. Listen to yourself, man. You\\'re hangin\\' with nerds. You take that back... Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they\\'re clearly nerds. Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy. Oh, not Souter... Oh, no. Come on, Mr. Simpson, you\\'ll never pass this course if you don\\'t know the periodic table. I\\'ll write it on my hand... Ho. Including all known Lanthanides and Actinides? Good luck! C\\'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I\\'m gonna show you the true meaning of college! We\\'re gonna go out and par-ty! Wait a minute, I\\'ll put on my snow pants. Me too. Me too. Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem? If you\\'re going for a ride I\\'d like you to take Bart and Lisa. But Marge, we\\'re college guys and we\\'re up to no good... Mr. Simpson? Gary spilled his ear medicine. Oh, those baby ducks were so cute. I can\\'t believe they let us walk right up and feed them. I need to go to the bathroom. We stopped five minutes ago. Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn\\'t go. I\\'m telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean\\'ll go nuts! I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge. So it\\'s a prank you\\'re lookin\\' for, is it? I\\'ll give you your prank... The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they\\'re our best target. Those bastards... Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year\\'s homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot... And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge. What? Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight... Mr. Simpson, I don\\'t think he likes that. Of course he does. He\\'s a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly... Ow! Why you little... Hey, the pig\\'s acting kinda funny. He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor. Guys, he\\'s really sick. Hello, that sounds like a pig fainting. I\\'m sorry, boys, I\\'ve never expelled anyone before, but that pig had some powerful friends. Oh, you\\'ll pay. Don\\'t think you won\\'t pay. Guys, believe me, I didn\\'t mean to get you expelled... Oh, don\\'t worry Mr. Simpson. We can take care of ourselves. Uh, wallet inspector. Here you go. I believe that\\'s all in order. Huh, I can\\'t believe that worked. Hey, that\\'s not the wallet inspector. Marge, they don\\'t have anywhere to stay, and they\\'re geniuses. They\\'ll solve all our problems. They\\'ll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth. Mr. Simpson, we all have nose bleeds. Oh, for the love of... What\\'s wrong with this phone? It\\'s making crazy noises. Those \"crazy noises\" are computer signals. Yeah, some guys at M.I.T. are sending us reasons why Captain Picard is better than Captain Kirk. They\\'re out of their minds! I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy. Wow! My purpose in life is to witness this moment. We need the outlet for our rock tumbler. Plug it in! Plug it in! What? The rock tumbler or the TV? The TV! The TV! Wow! They\\'ll never let us show that again. Not in a million years! Dad, start diggin\\' some nerd holes. It\\'s bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can\\'t we do something? Look, I\\'m sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge? No. I want those geeks out of my house. You really think you can get us back into college? Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme. Why does it have to be zany? I got it! We\\'re gonna fix it so you guys save the dean\\'s life. Perfect. Okay. We push him out of the way in exactly three seconds. Should we correct for wind resistance? Hmm. Possibly... What do you think? Oh my. Well, dean, I\\'m really sorry for the running-you-over prank. Prank? And all those other pranks were my idea too. I\\'m the one who should be expelled. Well, I\\'m touched by your honesty. And who knows, perhaps I\\'ve been a bit of an ogre myself. Yes, you have. How\\'s this, I\\'ll re-admit your friends and we\\'ll forget this whole silly incident ever occurred. Oh, Dean, this is what your new hip is going to look like. You\\'re gonna have to go easy on it. Oh, it\\'s good to be back after all these weeks. Better check our answering machine, huh? Number of messages received zero. We really want to thank you, Mr. Simpson. No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends. So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow\\'s big final exam. Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams. What are you gonna do Mr. Simpson? Actually, I\\'ve been working on a plan. During the exam, I\\'ll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out. Or, with our help you could cram like you\\'ve never crammed before. Whatever. Either way is good... Aw, man, I can\\'t believe you failed. I\\'m gonna lose my job just \\'cause I\\'m dangerously unqualified. Mr. Simpson, there is a way. We could... well, use a computer to change your grade. Computers can do that? Oh yes. The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires... Mora wuza? An \"A plus\"! How did you do it? Oh, let\\'s just say I had help from a \"little magic box...\" You changed your grade with a computer? Way to go, dad! Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college. No we didn\\'t. Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard. No you didn\\'t. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong. Hmmm, true. And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you\\'re gonna take that course over again without cheating. Oh, Marge. You\\'re worse than that crusty old dean. Well, I guess it\\'s back to college for me. And that means it\\'s time to... What did I teach you guys? Par-ty down? Yes. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. Shhh. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo. Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la. I am the happiest boy there is! Aren\\'t I Bobo? Happy! Come here, Happy! Yes, Momsie? Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents? Or would you rather live with this twisted loveless billionaire? Let\\'s roll. Wait! You forgot your bear! A symbol of your lost youth and innocence! Oh well. At least we still have his little brother George. Hm... I wonder what makes it turn? Ba-ba-ba-ba. Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home. Ba-ba-ba-ba trust me, it\\'ll be funny when I\\'m an old man. I want my teddy! Bobo! Bo-Bo! Oh, it\\'s you. The bedpan\\'s under my pillow. Who\\'s Bobo, sir? Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show. I see. On another topic, the preparations for your birthday have begun. I won\\'t get what I really want No one does. Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers. Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo! What? Homie! Oh no! Burns\\' Birthday! What\\'s wrong? Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job. Where is that dreaded piÃ±ata? Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow! Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt. That man who\\'s getting all those laughs, Smithers. Who is he? Homer Simpson, sir. One of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G. But I don\\'t think... I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life. Fine, sir. I\\'ll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esq material. Hee hee! I\\'m so funny! This is gonna be great. What are you doin\\'? I\\'m writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two? Who cares? I don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday. Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns\\' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man\\'s heart. Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants. Now I\\'m not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent... Incontinent... Too rich. Does either of you know what incontinent means? Lisa, don\\'t spoil our fun! Come on dear. It\\'s time to go. Okay, stupid! Homer! You\\'ve got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss. Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It\\'s what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure! Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor. Hey, no one-termers. You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place. Get away from me, loser. Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Montgomery Burns: the life. Bobo! Here are several fine young men, who I\\'m sure are gonna go far. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Ramones. Ahh, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves. I\\'d just like to say this gig sucks. Hey, up Yours, Springfield. One-two-three-four! Go to hell, you old bastard. Hey, I think they liked us. Have the Rolling Stones killed. Sir, those aren\\'t... This stinks... piffle... dust buster? Eych. Sir, I\\'ve arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There\\'s a satellite hookup on that monitor if you\\'ll just turn your head slightly. Eh, no time. Next! I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie was just run over in the parking lot. And now it\\'s time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson! Are you ready to laugh? Oh... That poor dog. I said are you ready to laugh?! Quiet, you awful man! You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap... What! I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old... How dare you! Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here\\'s an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky. I\\'m Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah. I think I\\'m so big. Blah, blah, blah. Destroy him. Blah, bla... Unghhhh! This party is over. Oh, where did I lose \\'em? I\\'ll never wiggle my bare butt in public again. I\\'d like to believe that this time. I really would. Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father. Yes\\'m. Dad, I know you\\'re discouraged, but please don\\'t deny the world your fat can. Don\\'t worry, boy. He\\'ll be ready for your Aunt Selma\\'s birthday. I knew it. Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he\\'ll pay. Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns. King Arthur\\'s Excalibur. The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word \"suckers\" in it. Yes, yes, yes. So what? You want your bear, Bobo, don\\'t you? Liar! I\\'ll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he\\'s gone. Gone forever. I\\'d give anything to know what happened to him. Put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You\\'re late. This is all your fault! You\\'ve got to start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition. If you can think of a better way to get ice, I\\'d like to hear it. Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it. Oooh! A head bag! Those are chock full of... heady goodness. Hey, it\\'s a Teddy bear! Ew! Gross! It\\'s probably diseased or something. Here, Maggie. Here\\'s something that should cheer you up, sir. It\\'s me sir. Bobo. Hug me. Squeeze me. Tug at my fur. Enough. Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my Teddy. Oh, and uh... leave the costume. The Burns Bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now. It could be right in front of your face as I\\'m saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one. Maggie, I\\'m trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down. Moldy!?! Old!?!... I\\'m gonna get something to eat! Right. That makes sense. No! Lemme go! Well, it\\'s not your original bear, of course. But it Is programmed to be just as cuddly. Oh dog gone it... It\\'s supposed to be doing a little dance. Get this bear off... I\\'m trying to turn it off. No, bear want to live. How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns\\' bear! Bobo. It\\'s Mr. Burns\\' bear all right. Well, Burns isn\\'t gettin\\' this back cheap, I\\'ll tell you that. He\\'s going to have to give me... my own recording studio. Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun... Homer, you\\'re drooling on the mic again. I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much. Hmm, better sew that eye back on. No. Let\\'s send Burns the eye in the mail. He\\'ll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger. Yes. We\\'ll send the eye. I\\'m sure he\\'ll offer us a fair reward. And then we\\'ll make him double it. Well why can\\'t I be greedy once in awhile? Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I\\'ll never leave you behind again. Ah, yes. Naturally I can\\'t pay you much of a reward because... I\\'m strapped for cash. As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I\\'m sure we can come to an understanding. Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer. May I offer you a drink? Sorry, Burns. No deal. Don\\'t worry, Smithers, he\\'s playing hard ball now. But it won\\'t take him long to crack. I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink! Nope. I knew you\\'d come crawling back. How much do you want? A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones. Done. Now, give me that bear. Woo hoo! I\\'m rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go. It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie! Give me the bear! The bear! The bear! Here you go, Maggie. The deal\\'s off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here. You\\'ve made a mistake, Simpson. Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We\\'re gettin\\' by okay. Son! You\\'ve gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don\\'t have any insurance. So, hows \\'bout you? Excellent shot, Smithers. I\\'ll be squeezing my Bobo in no time. Howdy gents. What can I diddily do you for? Remember, Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds. More cocoa, Mr. Burns? Yes. Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese. Sixty four... sixty three... Have you been up all night eating cheese? I think I\\'m blind. Good day to you. Excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money. Right here. Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball. My life can\\'t get any worse. Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties. After lunch can I whip you? Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn\\'t you be just as happy playing with... this box! See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do... Do do do do doo... No! My box! My box! I think we need a new hairdryer. Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns\\' money. I don\\'t hate you, I\\'m proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most. Aw thanks, Marge. But it\\'ll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul. Box... Gimme that. TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... I can see why this is so popular. Give me my bear, Simpson. It\\'s the Soulll Mass Transit System. Give it to me. Es yo-yo is grande. Aye Chihuahua. As you can see, Simpson, I\\'ve taken over all seventy-eight channels. And you won\\'t see any of your favorite shows again until you give in. Whoa, that bites. Holy crap. What\\'s that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer? That\\'s right. Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer swilling tube jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson. Homer, give him what he wants. Oh, Barney, leave me alone. Oops! Uh-oh. My old man can\\'t get a beer because his old man won\\'t give a bear to another old man. Let\\'s get him. Wait, why are we gettin\\' him? Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season. Never mind. Let\\'s just get him. Yeah! Smithers, I\\'m home! What, already? Yes. Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse? Eh, it\\'s about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers! I love this show Well well, look whose come to apologize. C\\'mon. Let\\'s go in there and get the bear! I got it! Aw jeez, will you look at that? What have we become? We\\'ve given the word mob a bad name! She\\'s gonna break a lot of hearts, Homer. I love what you\\'ve done with the house, Marge, etc... What should we do now? Hey, everybody. Let\\'s go sing at the hospital! FOR WE\\'VE GOT... HI-GH HOPES / WE\\'VE GOT HI-GH HOPES. Simpson, look what you\\'ve reduced me to. Please... please. But Mr. Burns, it\\'s not my bear. It\\'s Maggie\\'s. So, good sand today, hm. Well, I don\\'t usually... well, just this once. Ugh. Damn you, paparazzo! Well, Maggie, I\\'ve given this a lot of thought. I\\'m sure we can come to some sort of agreement. Beaten by an infant. What could be more humiliating? Well, there were a few left but we chucked them at an old man for kicks. Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang on to that bear. Don\\'t make the same mistake I made. For me? Bobo? Smithers, I\\'m so happy. Something amazing has happened. I\\'m actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I\\'m only going to be good and kind to everyone. Sorry, sir, I don\\'t have a pencil. Eh, don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure I\\'ll remember it. Well, we didn\\'t get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I\\'m confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending? It\\'s an ending, that\\'s enough. There you go. Ah, Bobo reunited at last. But I can\\'t help but wonder what the future holds for you. Ah, yes. Wonder... Bobo I know I say this every century, but I\\'ll never leave you behind again. Wait for me, sir. Paintings. Lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. But at night, they take on a life of their own. They become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that -- Bart! You should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they\\'d rather listen to that old War of the Worlds broadcast on NPR, Hmmm? Yes, mother. Good, now you hold Maggie. I\\'m going to buy some earrings at the gift shop. The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to... Buh Dmfl! The Devil! And next in our fall catalogue: we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream. Oooh, pure genius... Oh. Pure genius. And now to make the leap from dreams to reality. Sorry Homer. While you were daydreaming, we ate all the donuts. Damn buzzards! I ain\\'t dead yet. All right. Stay calm. Remember your training. Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He\\'s always one step ahead. Oh, I\\'d sell my soul for a donut! Well, that can be arranged. Flanders! You\\'re the devil? It\\'s always the one you least suspect! Now many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifica... Do you have a donut or not? Comin\\' up, just sign here. Careful, hot pen. Hmm... Who\\'s that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib. Uh, the Prince of Darkness, sir. He\\'s your eleven o\\'clock. Now remember: the instant you finish it, I own your soul for -- Hey, wait. If I don\\'t finish this last bite, you don\\'t get my soul, do you? Technically no, but -- I\\'m smarter than the de-vil! I\\'m smarter than the dev- You are not smarter than me! I\\'ll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson! Not likely. Heh, heh. Mmmm... forbidden donut. Well, well. Finishing something? Homer?! Did you eat that donut? No. Your wide behind won\\'t save you this time. Hey, Bart. Hey. Wait! Doesn\\'t my father have the right to a fair trial? Oh you Americans with your due process and fair trials. This is always so much easier in Mexico. All right. Very well. We\\'ll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. \\'Til then, you\\'re going to spend the day in hell. Eh, that wasn\\'t so bad. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. So, you like donuts, eh? Uh, huh. Well! Have all the donuts in the world!! More. Mmmm. I don\\'t understand it. James Coco went mad in 15 minutes. Homer! Are you all right? No. Mr. Simpson, don\\'t you worry. I watched Matlock in a bar last night. The sound wasn\\'t on, but I think I got the gist of it. Hear ye, hear ye! The Court of Infernal Affairs is now in session. Very well. But first, some ground rules. Number one: We get bathroom breaks every half-hour. Agreed. Number two: The jury will be chosen by me. Agreed. No, wait... Silence! I give you... the jury of the damned. Benedict Arnold. Lizzie Borden. Richard Nixon... But I\\'m not dead yet. In fact, I just wrote an article for Redbook. Hey listen, I did a favor for you. Yes, Master. John Wilkes Booth. Blackbeard the pirate. John Dillinger. And, the starting line of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers. I\\'m sorry, Mr. Blackbeard, we\\'re low on chairs and this is the last one. Arrr. This chair be high, says I. Ahem! I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson, pledging me his soul for a donut. Which I delivered! And it was scrum-diddly-umptious! I simply ask for what is mine. That was a right pretty speech, sir. But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster\\'s defines it as an agreement under the law which is unbreakable. Which is unbreakable. Excuse me, I must use the restroom. Uh... Mr. Hutz? Homer Simpson, I have no choice but to sentence you to an eternity -- Wait! Before you send him to hell, there\\'s something you should see. That\\'s a photo of Homer and me at our wedding. Wait a minute. You got married in an emergency room? Well... Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding. Read the back, the back. Arrr... \\'Tis some kind of treasure map. You idiot, you can\\'t read. Aye, \\'tis true. My debauchery was my way of compensatin\\'. Dear Marge, you have given me your hand in marriage. All I can give you in return is my soul, which I pledge to you forever. We\\'ve heard enough. Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson\\'s soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil. No. Woo hoo! Ow! All right Simpson. You get your soul back. But let that ill-gotten donut be forever on your head. Homer, stop picking at it. But I\\'m so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work. Dad, I wouldn\\'t go outside if I were you. Don\\'t worry, boys. He\\'s gotta come out of there sometime. The next exhibit in our ghoulish gallery is entitled...The school bus!? Oh oh... They must mean the ghoul bus. Nope. It says right there, school bus. Well, there\\'s nothing scarier than having to go to school. Ugh. Hey, Bart, look! Krusty Trading Cards! The long awaited Eighth Series! Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland... Krusty Poses for Trading Card Photo. Hmm. He seems to be running a little low on ideas. Well, at least you got the gum. Oww! I cut my cheek! Ooh, I hope this is sweat. Bart, what\\'s wrong? I just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death. And...? Lisa, your brother\\'s obviously had a nightmare. Don\\'t worry, honey, the scary part\\'s over. Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy\\'s boat! Hello, Simpson. I\\'m riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it. Excuse me, Bart\\'s a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him? Hey, where\\'s your diaper, baby? Thank goodness he\\'s drawn attention away from my shirt. Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window. No way, Bart. If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, Wet Willies, or even the dreaded Rear Admiral. Otto, you gotta do something! There\\'s a gremlin on the side of the bus! Hey, no problem-o, Bart-dude. I\\'ll get rid of it. No. Oh, no. I just made my last payment. Eyahh! Everybody! There\\'s a monster on the side of the bus! Hey, there\\'s no monster! You\\'re deceptive. I don\\'t see anything. Hey, who\\'s driving the bus? Oh, uno momento, por favor. Foolish Earthlings! Frightened of a creature that does not exist. Gllll. Now I\\'ve gotten word that a child is using his imagination, and I\\'ve come to put a stop to it. No! No, it\\'s true! There\\'s a monster on the bus. The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for the rules. Ach! My mule wouldn\\'t walk in the mud! So I had to put 17 bullets in him. You believe me, don\\'t you? You\\'re my friend who believes me! Sweet, trustworthy Milhouse. Actually, Bart, you\\'re kinda creepin\\' me out. Uh, I think I\\'m gonna go sit, uh... with that foreign exchange student. Oh Guten tag! Vould you care for a bite of my VenglerStrasse bar? I also have a bag of marzipan Joy-Joys! The gremlin\\'s taking off the wheel! Stop the bus or we\\'re all gonna die! Take me bridle and lash \\'is hands to the seat! Would you like another lick of my Flavor-Wax? Uh, sure. Well, now that we\\'re friends, Uter, how \\'bout loosening these straps, huh? Ja. Das ist gut. Hey boy! Pull, Willie! Pull! I\\'m doin\\' all the pullin\\' you blouse wearing poodle walker. Oh, dear Lord! It\\'s some sort of hideous monster. Aww, isn\\'t that cute? He\\'s trying to claw my eyes out. Gad Zooks! Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right! Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man. Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners. Haw haw! At least now I can get some rest. Hidilly ho, Bart! We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad. They\\'re dogs! And they\\'re playing poker! We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy! Another local peasant has been found dead, drained of his blood, with two teeth marks on his throat. This black cape was found on the scene: police are baffled. We think we\\'re dealing with a supernatural being, most likely a mummy. As a precaution, I\\'ve ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield Museum destroyed. That\\'s nice work, Ed. No, no, they\\'re wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead. Nosferatu! Das Wampyre! A vampire! Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos. In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just closed a deal to buy the Springfield Blood Bank. Oh, I\\'m very excited about this deal... Oh... Precious blood. Hmmm... business deal. It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania. Ah, there\\'s something fishy about this whole setup. Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked? Sure did. Welcome, come in. Ah, fresh victims for my ever-growing army of the undead. Sir, you have to let go of the button. Oh, son of a bi... Well if it isn\\'t my good friends, the uh... Simpson family, master. Simpson, eh? Excellent! Dad, do you notice anything strange? Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer. I heard that! It was the boy! Huh, ooooh, punch! Eww, Dad, this is blood. Correction. Free blood. Ahhh. Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up. But, you didn\\'t get any on m... Uhhh. Lisa, Burns isn\\'t a vampire. And even if he was, we\\'re not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place. You\\'re probably right. Let\\'s just go back... Satisfied? Big deal. It\\'s no different from the basement in Grampa\\'s rest home. Look! Oh my God! Be be be be be. Please, Bart, I\\'ve seen your stupid Shemp. Nyung, nyung, nyung nyung. Yeah, I\\'ve seen your Curly too. I know I really shouldn\\'t, but when am I going to be here again? Whee! Well, if it isn\\'t little... boy. Mom, Dad! Mr. Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart! Why Bart is right here. Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence. Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let\\'s go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is. Come join us, Lisa. It\\'s so cool! You get to stay up all night drinking blood! And if you say you\\'re a vampire, you get a free small soda at the movies. No! No! Lisa, it\\'s not like you have a choice here. Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire. Quick! We have to kill the boy! How\\'d you know he\\'s a vampire? He\\'s a vampire?! Homer, we gotta do something! Today he\\'s drinking people\\'s blood, tomorrow he could be smoking! The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream? This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie. Super Fun Happy Slide! No, Dad. I guess killing will be fun enough. You must drive this stake right through his heart. Take that, vile fiend! Uh, Dad, that\\'s his crotch. Oh, sorry. You\\'re fired! It\\'s so nice having everything back to normal. I\\'m a vampire and I\\'ve come to suck your blood. Blah. This cape is giving me a rash. Grampa\\'s a vampire?! We\\'re all vampires. But, no, we killed Mr. Burns. You have to kill the head vampire. You\\'re the head vampire? No, I\\'m the head vampire! Mom?! Homer? Well, I do have a life outside this house, you know. Happy Halloween, everybody! LU, LU, LU / LU LU LU LU LU / LU LU LU LU LU LU LU Well sir, it has been an uneventful week in Badger Falls, where the women are robust, the men are pink-cheeked and the children are pink-cheeked and robust. What the hell\\'s so funny? At the Apple Biscuit Cafe, where the smiles are free, don\\'t ya know, Sven Ingqvist studied the menu. And finally, he ordered the same thing he has every day. Maybe it\\'s the TV. Stupid TV. Be more funny. Well sir, I think it\\'s time to turn this pledge drive over to Troy McClure. I can\\'t keep up this pace forever. Hi, I\\'m Troy McClure. You might remember me from such telethons as: \"Out With Gout \\'88!\" and \"Let\\'s Save Tony Orlando\\'s House!\" Folks, do you realize without your support, public television can\\'t afford to bring you such award-winning shows as \"Edward the Penitent?\" I\\'m really, really, really sorry. I\\'m afraid sorry doesn\\'t cut it with this Pope. Gllllll. What the hell...? Oooh, we got a call. Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in! Hello! What\\'s your name? Marge Simpson. I\\'d like to pledge thirty dollars. Oh, thank you! Marge, it\\'s public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es? They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet. The ballet? Woo hoo! You like ballet? Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet. Hello, Ruth? Hi, Marge. I was wondering if you had a power sander I could borrow? That\\'s one right there. All right, but remember it\\'s mine. That\\'s what ballet is? You promised. You can\\'t back out like when you volunteered for that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters\\'. Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium? Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum. Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it. Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home? I can\\'t. I gotta take my wife to the ballet. Gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh? Mmmm... invisible cola. Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man. Hey careful there, Homer. I heard somebody lost an arm in there once. Phht, that\\'s just an old wives tale. Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it! I\\'m stuck! Help me! He\\'s done for! Let\\'s get outta here! Must... get to ballet... promised Marge... Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap! Mmmmm, candy. Hello? Marge, this may be hard to believe, but I\\'m trapped inside two vending machines. Sure, Homer. Trapped in vending machines. Okay. Would you two like to go to the ballet? That\\'s girl stuff. Thanks, Marge. When my husband left, he took all our power tools, along with the car... my youth... my faith in mankind... Well, see ya. Hey wait! Vyachepov\\'s loins oughtta be outlawed. Far too much dancing, not nearly enough prancing. And a little mincing would be nice. Well, thank you for a lovely time. You\\'re not going home already, are you? It\\'s almost nine-thirty! Yeah right, we\\'d better turn in. Oh, you were serious. I\\'m going to have these things on my arms forever! Candy and sodas for all! Mmmm... convenient. Homer, this is never easy to say. I\\'m gonna have to saw your arms off. They\\'ll grow back, right? Oh, yeah. Homer, are you just holding onto the can? Your point being? I envy you and Homer. Thank you. Why? If you ever met my ex-husband, you\\'d understand. All he ever did was eat, sleep and drink beer. Your point being? And to top it off, he\\'s been stiffing me on child support for the last four months. Well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there. Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom? I\\'ll buy somethin\\'. Marge, I know you didn\\'t believe me about the vending machines. That\\'s why I had the fireman write me a note. Hey, baby, feel like getting lucky? \"Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down.\" Lumber has a million uses. I\\'m disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers. In fact, we\\'re going out again tomorrow night. Marge, that\\'s twice. I think you\\'re spending entirely too much time with this woman. Homer, please. You know it\\'s hard for me to make friends. Heh, heh. Oh Marge, we should do this every Thursday. Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it\\'s doing it again! Marge, you can\\'t go out on Saturday. That\\'s our special night. What\\'s so special about it? What the... Oh, I don\\'t know... a little show called \"Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman\"?! Where you going? I don\\'t know. When will you be home? I\\'m not sure. Where you going? You already asked me that. Will you bring me back something? Don\\'t wait up. How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children? Have a blast, Mom! Rock the Casbah! Man\\'s best friend, indeed. You look... nice. Tonight has nothin\\' to do with nice. Tonight\\'s all about... Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows... Oh, sorry, Marge, wrong tape. I can\\'t believe your mother went out to have fun without me. Don\\'t worry. You\\'ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, Homina... I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much. Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There\\'s nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa? Sure Dad. That\\'s it! I\\'m calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls\\' night out. Oh no can do Homer, I\\'m watchin\\' the game. Shave up, not down, you idiot. Ooh sounds delish. Let me just toss some jeans on and... Wait a minute! Who is this?! Well howdilly dodilly-do! Hello? Hello? Hellodilly-odilly? Fine! I can have a great time all by myself! Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter. Oh Lisa, haven\\'t you seen \"Home Alone?\" If some burglars come, it\\'ll be a very humorous and entertaining situation. You\\'re absolutely right, Homer. We don\\'t need a baby-sitter. Wait a second... You kids do need a baby-sitter. Blast that infernal card! Don\\'t give that card to me. Here you g... Nnnnnno. Mr. Simpson. I was just going through your garbage and I couldn\\'t help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. Of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour. We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer. Three. Two. Okay, two. And I get to keep this old bird cage. Done. Still got it. Oh... I\\'ve heard a lot about Shot Kickers. Ach. How come no one else\\'s chair is doing this? Listen, baby, I always get what I want. I said, no. Oh, did you? Oh I completely misunderstood. Please accept our apologies. Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name. Hi guys! Moe, get the darts. I want to play. No. We\\'re phasing out the games. People drink less when they\\'re havin\\' fun. Oh sure! Like lawyers work in big skyscrapers and have secretaries. Ha! Look at him! He\\'s wearing a belt! That\\'s Hollywood for you. Ooh, I\\'ve never been to an underground club. Don\\'t you think your hair is a bit much? Hey, Mrs. Simpson! You could try one of these smart drinks. Oh, wow... I\\'ve wasted my life. Would you, ahh, care to dance? Mayor Quimby! What are you doing here? I\\'m here with my nephews. Oh, that\\'s nice. Ooooh, \"Jet!\" Woo hoo! It\\'s Garret Morris\\' birthday. This is not a library! This is not a Kwik-E-Mart! What was it you wanted to show me? This. You\\'re not going to hunt me for sport, are you? Oh relax, Marge. I\\'d never turn a gun on a human being. My husband, on the other hand... Come on, you try it. No. I couldn\\'t. Yeah, just breathe slowly and squeeze the -- I hit it! I hit it! My cans! My precious antique cans! Aw, look what ya done to \\'em! Oh, it\\'s getting late. Maybe we should call it a night. Phht, it\\'s only midnight. Come on, I know a place. Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates. Homer, stop that! It\\'s just a weather station. Come on Marge. It\\'s fun to smash things. I smashed it good! You got real purdy hair. You know Marge, of all the places we\\'ve been tonight, I think I like this one the best. Me too. Look, you can see our houses. There\\'s an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney. Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers? As of this moment, Lionel Hutz no longer exists. Say hello to Miguel Sanchez. Maybe we should call it a night. Okay. I should get home to my daughter before that naked talk show comes on. Ah, young love. The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I\\'ll bash it good! It\\'s just no fun without Marge. Ahhh. There\\'s nothing like moonshine from your own still. Oh, Simpson! What are you doing here? My wife\\'s having a girls\\' night out. Eh, just get one of those inflatable women. But make sure it\\'s a woman... \\'Cause one time I... Eh come on, I\\'ll uh... I\\'ll give you a ride home. I miss you, Marge. There are ghost cars all over these highways ya know. Huh, their left taillight\\'s a little smaller than their right one. I better pull \\'em over. I think they want us to stop. Fat chance. This car is stolen. Stolen?! Looks like we got ourselves an old fashioned car chase. SUNSHINE, LOLLIPOPS AND RAINBOWS AND EVERYTHING / THAT\\'S WONDERFUL IS WHAT I FEEL WHEN WE\\'RE TOGETHER / BRIGHTER THAN A LUCKY PENNY WHEN YOU\\'RE NEAR THE RAIN CLOUDS DISAPPEAR AND... Ruth, is there something you want to tell me? Remember when I said my ex-husband was behind on his child support? Mmm hmm. Yeah, well to even things up, I kind of stole his car. Didn\\'t you realize all you had to do was report him to the police? Marge, you\\'re the level-headed friend I never had. We\\'re in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair. A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak. It\\'s Marge! She\\'s become a crazed criminal, just because I didn\\'t take her to the ballet. That\\'s exactly how Dillinger got started. Really? I don\\'t want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up. Marge, it\\'s a matter of principle. I just can\\'t let that deadbeat win again. You\\'re with me, aren\\'t ya? Look, Marge, there\\'s no reason for you to get dragged into this. Once we lose the cops, I\\'ll let ya out. Oh, I don\\'t think they\\'re gonna be that easy to lose. I mean these are professional lawmen and... Oh my God, it just disappeared! It\\'s a ghost car! Only if you hold me. You can call a cab in there. Well, bye. Sorry about all this. But you gotta admit we did have some fun. Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely. Hey, you\\'re a good friend, Marge. This cross country flight from the law would be hell if we didn\\'t stick together. Hey, friends stick together. It\\'s amazing how through all this adversity we managed to stick together. If there\\'s one thing decent folk do, it\\'s stick together. I hate it when the waffles stick together. Sticking together is what good waffles do. Thanks, kid. Marge, what are you doing? Ruth, I\\'ve done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is... You stupid kid! You know that drives away all my business! See you tomorrow, loser. Mmmm, engine block eggs. If we can keep these down, we\\'ll be sittin\\' pretty. That\\'s them! Quiet. I can\\'t hear the eggs. Hey, it\\'s morning, and Mom and Dad aren\\'t home yet. Don\\'t worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us. Hey, don\\'t touch my stuff! Hey, this isn\\'t the YMCA. Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum back in pursuit of the rebelling women. All right. Your current location? Oh, uhhh... I\\'m on a road... looks to be asphalt. Aw geez, trees, shrubs, I\\'m directly under the Earth\\'s sun... now. We now interrupt this program for a special bulletin. We\\'ve just received word of a high-speed desert chase. The suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of Springfield. Cool! I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors. Eh, shut your yap. At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion. Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women, leading to anarchy of biblical proportions. It\\'s in Revelations, people! Look! We\\'re only two miles from the state line. We\\'re gonna make it, we\\'re gonna be okay. My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield! That\\'s it, I give up. A single mother can\\'t win in a man\\'s world. Ruth, that\\'s a lot of hooey. It\\'s not over until it\\'s over. I\\'m sorry, I should have asked first. No Marge, you did it! We really are gonna make it now. Oh no, they\\'re headed right for the Grand Chasm. Oh my God. They\\'re gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it\\'s all my fault! Marge! Marge! Homer?! Look, Marge, I\\'m sorry I haven\\'t been a better husband. I\\'m sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I\\'m sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I\\'m sorry... Oh well let\\'s just say I\\'m sorry for the whole marriage up to this point. You\\'re right. I am lucky to have him. But please Marge, don\\'t drive into that chasm! Chasm?! Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill. Solid waste, I could kiss you. Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza. Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield superior court. The judge dismissed her ex-husband\\'s auto theft charges and forced him to pay all back child support. Mr. Powers blamed the outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz. Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Doctor Nguyen Van Thoc, was paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of baby-sitting. He was glad to get it. Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code Section 618A, wanton destruction of precious antique cans. She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish. Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army neuro-chemical research center at Fort Meade Maryland for extensive testing. Woo hoo! Quit it, Bart. Quit it. Quit it. Quit it. Mom, Bart\\'s making faces. Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him. Heh. Heh. Stupid animals. Ahh, the daily newspaper. Oooh! The Springfield Men\\'s Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses! Why do you read that \"Free\" column, Homer? They never have anything good. OH MY GOD! What is it? Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een! He said what now? Please don\\'t bring home anymore old crutches! Oh no, you don\\'t! That trampoline is MINE. Huh? Hey! That seltzer ain\\'t free. Krusty! That\\'s me. You here for the trampoline? Yeah. What\\'s the deal? Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I\\'m phasing it out for more dirty limericks. There once was a man named Enos -- And I can just haul it away? Free? Yup. It\\'s all yours. You\\'re a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha? Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son. WOWWW!! I can\\'t believe it! Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering. Look at me! / I will never get tired of this. I\\'m going to have my wedding here. I don\\'t know if this is a good idea. Marge, it\\'s the perfect exercise. It\\'ll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!! Are you sure it\\'s safe? Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I\\'ve got some big plans. It smells funny in there. No it doesn\\'t! Otto! You okay? Yeah, just pop my shoulder back in. Thanks, buddy... Hey, I lost my turn! Ohh... My arm! Wee! Ow, I bit my tongue! Each leap brings us closer to God! Catch me, Lord! Catch me! What have we done to make God angry? You did it! Stop jumping on me! I\\'m hurt! Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump. Homer, this is terrible! Okay, okay. I\\'ll take care of it. I told you this was a bad idea! All right, all right! I\\'ll get rid of the trampoline! Hey, Krusty! I\\'m bringing back the... You just keep right on drivin\\'. There we go. That\\'s the last I\\'ll see of Mr. Trampoline. Yep, it\\'s finally gone. If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now. I\\'m thirsty. Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline. All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you\\'ll rust. Rust I tell ya. Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline? Uh-huh. Observe - a bike lock. Now just turn around and count to three. One, two, three. Uh, better make it five. All right, I got me a bed. Shh! Quiet! You\\'ll wake up Ol\\' Man Simpson. Hey, no more trampoline. Let\\'s jump on the car instead. Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I\\'m out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we\\'d ever do is work and go to church! That\\'s not true. Name one thing you\\'ve done in the past month that was fun. I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes... That\\'s not fun! Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time? Um... Uh, well... Uh... See, Marge? I didn\\'t realize people saw me that way. Are you mad? No. I\\'m fine. I\\'m going to my sisters\\' now. Ooh, careful there, Marge! Almost nicked me! Your blood pressure is off the chart. And I don\\'t like this urine sample one bit. You\\'re headed for a nervous breakdown. You need Brad Goodman. His infomercial plays round-the-clock on channel 77. Thank you, Martha Quinn. There you have it - unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities. She\\'s one of my favorites. I loved her in the thing I saw her in. You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder in the \"Feel Bad\" rainbow. Let\\'s look at the rainbow. What\\'s in there? Depression, insomnia, motor-mouth, darting eyes, indecisiveness, decisiveness, bossiness, uncontrollable falling down, Geriatric Profanity Disorder or GPD, and chronic nagging. Nagging, nagging, nagging... Sorry, it does that sometimes. What up, Marge? I\\'m watching a videotape that could change our lives. Marge, can I go outside and play? Shhh! Thank you so much, Troy. And by the way, I\\'m not happy you\\'re still drinking. But at least you\\'re down to one from more than fifty. Folks, I\\'m often asked about my qualifications. Well, I may not have a lot of \"credentials\" or \"training.\" But I\\'ll tell you one thing -- I\\'m a Ph.D. in Pain. Now let me show you how you can change your life. Troy, this circle is you. That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I\\'m just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script. And that sends me into a shame spiral. Exactly! So from now on, I\\'m going to quit nagging and have more fun. Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies? Uh-oh. You\\'re in for it now, Dad. Marge, I\\'m feeling a lot of shame right now. I\\'m hearing that you feel a lot of shame. And I feel that you hear my shame. I\\'m feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance. I feel validated by that. Good. I\\'m glad we had this talk. Me too. Wow! For free, \"SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM.\" Brad Goodman is coming to town! Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman? Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture. We know, Dad. I just thought I\\'d remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar. What an odd thing to say. Thank you. Okay folks, let me hear what\\'s troubling you. Don\\'t be shy. Yell it out! Everybody, go! I uh, can\\'t commit to a relationship! I\\'m too nice! I have problems with... I\\'m always interrupting people! Stay the course, Big Ned. You\\'re doin\\' super! Food goes in here. It sure does! Hey, Moe. What\\'s a matta? You no talka with your accent no more. Mamma mia! Principal Skinner, Let\\'s try some rage work. I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother. Okay... I\\'ll try. Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel, right now. I\\'m annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I\\'m a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!! Shh. Shh. Calm down. Calm down. Aw, moving. You can sit down now... We\\'re still going antiquing on Saturday, right, mother? You see, folks? We\\'re all trying to please someone else. And as soon as you\\'re not a human BE-ING, you\\'re a human DO-ING! Then what comes next? A human GOING! Bart! Be quiet! Son, that\\'s wonderful. Come here. Come up here. What made you yell out that remark? I \\'unno. You just wanted to express yourself. Yes? I do what I feel like. That\\'s marvelous! I-I couldn\\'t have put it better myself. \"I do what I feel like.\" People, this young man here IS the inner child I\\'ve been talking about. What!? Son, you\\'ve never read any of my books, have you? Earth to boring guy. That means no, eh? I\\'m not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama, Papa -- could you come up here? Thank you. Very, very much. This is really remarkable. Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder, and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle I\\'m sure worn only for shock value... ... and yet they\\'ve managed to raise an emotionally healthy son. That\\'s fantastic. Oh, thank you. We can all learn a lot from this young man, here, this... this... Rudiger. Rudiger. And if we can all be more like little Rudiger... His name is Bart. His name isn\\'t important. What\\'s important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity, with well-defined boundaries. Ha ha. People, I am excited. I can sense a change in the air tonight. You are all gonna start living. Really living! YAAAYYY! LI-VING! LI-VING! Be like the boy! BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY! Just the ladies! BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY! Now the seniors in the back! WE-LIKE-ROY! WE-LIKE-ROY! This is madness. He\\'s just peddling a bunch of easy answers. And how! A new mood is in the air in Springfield, as refreshing as a pre-moistened towelette. Folks are finally accepting their feelings and really communicating, with no holding back. And this reporter thinks it\\'s about fucking time. Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp who taught us that if it feels good, do it. Lis, today I am a god. Is that why you\\'re sitting on an ice cream sandwich? Ewww... uhh. Now instead of my boring old sermon, I\\'m going to take a page from the book of Bart and do something I\\'ve always wanted to do. Take five, Mrs. Fische. Wait! Wait... I can do this. Wait! wait... hold on. The wireless was an invention by Guglielmo Marconi. Who can tell me what his first message was? I want-a to change-a my name-a! It was... Our 10th caller will receive tickets to \\'Supertramp\\'. Aw geez. Everybody\\'s a comedian. I\\'m blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass. Oh, man. Lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck? It\\'s simple, Bart. You\\'ve defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted. I see. Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you\\'ve lost your identity. You\\'ve fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society. What\\'s the answer? Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest \"good-natured doormat?\" Sounds good, sis. Just tell me what to do. Springfield will have its first annual \"DO WHAT YOU FEEL FESTIVAL\" this Saturday whenever you feel like showing up. It\\'ll be a welcome change from our annual \"DO AS WE SAY FESTIVAL,\" started by German settlers in 1946. Ach. If elected mayor, my first act will be to kill the whole lot of ye and burn yer town to cinders. I know it\\'s on. Park anywhere. I\\'m not gonna lay any rule trip on you today. I feel like such a free spirit. And I\\'m really enjoying this so-called \"iced cream.\" Sir, in the spirit of the festival and everything, I\\'d just like to say that I... love... you. ... In those colors. Oh, who am I kidding? The boathouse was the time. My God, they\\'re naked! Double your pleasure, Springfield. I\\'m sweatin\\'. Let\\'s ride through the car wash. Arr! This picture\\'ll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea. This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man. Cowabunga! Skateboards? You copycat wannabes. Ow! Eat my shorts, young man. Good afternoon, and welcome to the \"Do What You Feel Festival.\" By the way, this young lady is not my wife, but I am sleeping with her. I\\'m telling you this because I\\'m comfortable with my womanizing. And now, to usher in this new era of feeling good, is the uh godfather of soul, James Brown. I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD NOW / I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD / SO GOOD SO GOOD / I GOT YOU OW! Hey, wait a minute! Hold on, here. This bandstand wasn\\'t double bolted. I didn\\'t feel like it. Hey, I hear ya, buddy. Uh, I don\\'t want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should\\'ve done your job! Hey now, Marge. Let\\'s not \"should\" this fella to death. Yeah, next you\\'ll be laying a guilt trip on me for not oiling that ferris wheel. In the spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I think. You two screwed up royal. Ya know, I really don\\'t feel like being blamed. I feel that you should shut up! You know, you really irritate me, Skinner. What with your store-bought haircut and excellent posture. Mister, I can\\'t stand the sound of your voice. Oh really? Oh now, now, there\\'s no need to resort to violence. Ah, sure there is. I knew it. If only I had nagged more... God is angry. We\\'ve made a false idol of this Brad Goodman. No, you must not blame yourself, reverend. You must blame that little boy! He started it all! Get him! Eep. Hey, boy! In here! Hold on, son. So long, suckers! Damn! They\\'re very slowly getting away. They\\'re headin\\' for the old mill! No, we\\'re not. Well, let\\'s go to the old mill anyway -- get some cider! That\\'s a good idea. \"Cider!\" \"To the mill! There\\'s a good view!\" Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone. That\\'s not fair. The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities. No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It\\'s a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery. That\\'s what I\\'ve been saying. We\\'re all fine the way we are. Oooh, it\\'s that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time. Crank it, Homer. You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGarnigal. Did you really have to break so much furniture? You tell me, Chief. You had a pretty good view from behind your desk. Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain. You\\'re off the case, McGarnigal! You\\'re off your case, Chief. What does that mean, exactly? It means he gets results, you stupid chief. Dad, sit down. Oh, I\\'m sorry. ... thirsting for a way to name the unnameable, to express the inexpressible! Tell me more! Keep cool, Simpson. Be in the game, but not of the game. No es bueno! Winners don\\'t use drugs. Oh. I\\'m out of money. Don\\'t say that out loud. Two Caucasian males out of money in Sector Four. Go to code red. I\\'m sorry, you\\'ll have to leave. Oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon? You mustn\\'t kill time, boys -- you must cherish it! Seize the day! Can I have some change, to go get loaded? Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites. \"Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings.\" Mmmmm. Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner. Steak? Money\\'s too tight for steak. Steak? Sure, steak. Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers. Uh oh. Something\\'s wrong. Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha! Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut. Explain how. Woo hoo! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. You know, this is wearing a bit thin. You think so? Bart, look! Maybe a plane exploded. Our prayers have been answered! Hello, gents. What will it be? Apu, give us a Super-Squishee. One that\\'s made: entirely out of syrup. Entirely out of... An all-syrup Super-Squishee? S-such a thing has never been done. Just make it happen. Oh dear... Won\\'t be long. She won\\'t hold! She\\'s breaking up! All done. If you survive, please come again. It\\'s so thick. Your turn, Bart. Wowww... That\\'s good Squishee. What\\'s it like, Bart? Bart? Bart...? Gimme that! Uh. OK... We\\'re young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do? Let\\'s go crazy, Broadway-style! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD!/ IT\\'S A HELL OF A TOWN!/ THE SCHOOLYARD\\'S UP AND THE SHOPPING MALL\\'S DOWN!/ THE STRAY DOGS GO TO THE ANIMAL POUND! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--! SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--! NEW YORK, NEW YORK--! NEW YORK IS THAT-A-WAY, MAN. Thanks, kid! It\\'s a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!! Mmmmm... free goo. Hey, don\\'t bogart that Squishee. I don\\'t know where you magic pixies came from, but I like your pixie drink. Ohhh... my head.... Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie. I don\\'t remember anything. Really? Not even this? Oh, no. I must have joined the Junior Campers! The few, the proud, the geeky. Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things. Uh oh. Not again. Okay look, I made a terrible mistake. I wandered into a Junior Camper recruitment center. But what\\'s done is done. I\\'ve made my bed and now I\\'ve got to weasel out of it. I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... \"uncool,\" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies. Marge, don\\'t discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It\\'s what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel. All I\\'ve gotta do is take this uniform back after school. You\\'re lucky, you only joined the Junior Campers. I got a dirty word shaved into the back of my head. What is it with you kids and that word? I\\'m going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it\\'s a privilege. What\\'s in the bag, wuss? Oooh, look! Camper\\'s pampers. Keep-away! Keep-away! Keep-away! Keep-away! Yeah. Whatever. You better pretend you want your uniform back, twerp. Keep-away! Keep-away! What a baby! Oh no. Woe is me, my precious uniform. Guess what, class! Time for a surprise quiz? Well, that\\'s not what I was gonna say, but it\\'s a good idea. Ha. Take out a sheet of paper, books under your desks. But I\\'m supposed to... I\\'ve got to... I\\'m supposed to... Um, Mrs. Krabappel...? I\\'d love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities. Hey look -- Sergeant Dork! Haw haw! Enjoy your test. Haw ha... ugh. Hel-lo, alternative to testing! Well it\\'s Bart Simpson! C\\'mon in! You\\'re just in time for \"Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!\" Help yourself, but stay above the equator. Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth. Nooo! Should I keep doing it? Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir. I\\'m outta here, man. Okay, now, everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives... You guys get to play with knives? Cool! A spork! Don\\'t hurt me. Oop, sorry, Bart, that\\'s a Neddy no-no. You\\'re not allowed to handle a pocketknife \\'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test. Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway? Knives are boring. When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it. You call that a knife? This is a knife. Down I go. Oh hi, Bart. I\\'d gladly share these sweet cookies with you, if only you Would help me remove this ribbon. Here\\'s a knife. Oh. Thank you. Now let\\'s all share the goodness. Share this! This man\\'s appendix is about to burst. Luckily, I have my trusty pocketknife. Stand back! Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Don\\'t thank me: thank the knife. Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives. Don\\'t Do What Donny Don\\'t Does. They could\\'ve made this clearer. They won\\'t let you have any fun. Well if it isn\\'t the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons. Homer, you should be more supportive. You\\'re right, Marge. Good work, boy. Egghead likes his bookie wook! Homer! Just tucking him in. Here you go, your rubber training knife. You\\'ve attained the rank of Pussy Willow. Rubber knife? This place is for wimps. Okay, kids, now I\\'m gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation. Hmmm... Oooh, floor pie. Hmm. BART!!!! Mmm... apple. The guys who wrote this show don\\'t know squat. Itchy should have tied Scratchy\\'s tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend. Oh, Bart, cartoons don\\'t have to be one hundred percent realistic. Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for today\\'s meeting? You know-it-know it, Neddy. You see anything yet? Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend. Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip? Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart. What an oaf. / How embarrassing. Glad he\\'s not my father. Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don\\'t you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya. But my older brother would like to... Sorry, but I\\'m afraid Ernest Borgnine has already been confirmed. Hiya. I\\'m sure you kids know me best as Sergeant Fatso Judson in \"From Here to Eternity.\" Yay! How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh? Stupid poetic justice...! Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip. Heh heh. You don\\'t have a son. Look, Homer won\\'t want to go, so just ask him, and he\\'ll say no. Then it\\'ll be his fault. I don\\'t want to go, so if he asks me to go, I\\'ll just say yes. Shut up, brain, or I\\'ll stab you with a Q-tip. Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me! Bart, I\\'d be delighted to go on your trip with you! Aw, c\\'mon kid, quit crying! It\\'ll be fun, I promise! Arrr, here be a fine vessel. The yarest river-goin\\' boat there be. I\\'ll take it. Arrr, I don\\'t know what I\\'m doin\\'. Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Well, Homer, looks like we\\'re boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer? I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh? You are not my son. Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought? Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible. Hey, there\\'s a new Mexico. Whoa, Nelly! Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--? So many Krustyburger locations. Uh-oh... no time. Matthew, Mark, Luke-and-John! Hey, where are the sissy and the bald guy going, HUH? Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current. Wrong again, Flanders. In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land. SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk! Hey! I got that for my birthday! Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash \\'em! Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It\\'s our only hope. Oh pardon me, Mr. Let\\'s Ration Everything, but what do you think we\\'re floatin\\' on? Don\\'t you know the poem? \"Water, water everywhere/ So let\\'s all have a drink.\" Homer! No! Ohh... What does it matter? We\\'re doomed! Run! We\\'ll hide at my house! Wrong, we\\'re saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die. Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders! Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help? Well, since you\\'re all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I\\'ll just be in charge of the rationing. Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so: STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD! Why couldn\\'t I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they\\'re having the time of their life. I keep telling you, lady, your husband and son have to be missing for a week before we can start searching. I\\'d like to help sooner, I would, but we\\'re very, very busy down here. King me. Still no help. You know, it is cougar season. And those things don\\'t mess around. A rescue plane! Get the flare gun! This ain\\'t one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing... All right, well that\\'s okay. When they come to rescue him, they\\'ll rescue us. Here\\'s our chance! Dolphins always help humans lost at sea. Come back! Come back! Oh, we\\'re done for! We\\'re done for! We\\'re Done-diddily-done for we\\'re done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily... Flanders! Snap out of it! Thank you, Homer, I dunno what got-- Dad, I think he\\'s oka-- It\\'s better to be safe than sorry. Sorry. Diddily. Nothing, Captain. Somebody took all the beer and coldcuts. That\\'s it. I\\'m not even casting off until we go to the store. You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food. You\\'ll thank me when we\\'re frying up a big juicy fish. Godspeed, li\\'l doodle. He\\'ll be back. Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We\\'re waiting. Son, there\\'s something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now. A real Swiss army knife. Cool! I stole it from that Borgnine guy. Don\\'t worry, kids, I\\'ll take care of him with my trusty... Uh... uh... Um.. Uh... Hmm... Dad, I know I\\'ve been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I\\'d give you a hug. Thanks boy. Now be careful when you... Dad, don\\'t take this wrong, but your expression doesn\\'t fill me with confidence. The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers. Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too. According to this map there\\'s a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig! That\\'s what you\\'re smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren\\'t for this blasted fog, we\\'d be saved! Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn\\'t much time! I\\'m taking a bath on this! We tried to tell you these are unmanned oil rigs. Close the damn thing down! No one\\'s ever gonna come. Give seven hundred Krustyburgers! You want fries with that? You did it, Dad! You saved us! I\\'m proud you\\'re my father. Go away. Eating. Well, it sure is lucky we stumbled upon this old abandoned Summer camp. Hey, how about a song? THERE WAS A FARMER WHO HAD A DOG, AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O... AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O. The beauty of it is each parking space is a mere one foot narrower. Indistinguishable to the naked eye. But therein lies the game. I fear to watch, yet I cannot turn away. I\\'m in the lines. You got a problem, go tell your mama. Oh don\\'t worry, she\\'ll hear about this. Class, I know there\\'s no way to prove who actually did this, and in our American Democracy, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. God bless America. But my classroom is not a democracy. Ha. For the rest of the year Bart Simpson will be the first student called on for every question. Well, let\\'s get started. Can someone pronounce this word? Hmm, Bart! Pick me, teacher. I\\'m ever so smart. It\\'s photosynthesis! Damn your feeble brain! Oh, I couldn\\'t read it. The letters are all blurry. Is it possible all your misbehavior and miserable grades have been caused by a simple vision disorder? You mean it ain\\'t me noggin, it\\'s me peepers? Well that\\'s just loverly. Watch this, guys. Uh oh, he\\'s done for. Don\\'t worry, the safety glass will protect us. Yes. Hey, this emergency exit is painted on. There\\'s no way out! There\\'s no way out! We\\'re doomed. Dooomed! Well sir, I won\\'t bore you with the details of our miraculous escape. But we desperately need a real emergency exit. Why that\\'s a fabulous idea. Anything else you\\'d like? How about real lead in the radiation shields? Urinal cakes maybe? Smithers, throw this at him. Smithers, where does that tube go? I\\'m not sure, sir. It was here when we moved in. Dance! Dance! Dance! Sir, we\\'ll need a new Dangerous Emissions Supervisor. Yes, well, find someone cheap. It\\'s been a very lean year for us. Money fight! Excellent, Zutroy. Work hard and each day you\\'ll get a shiny penny. Agent Wesson, Department of Labor. This man\\'s an illegal alien. That\\'s preposterous. Zutroy here is as American as apple pie. Dok nee grabb ga, Mr. Burns. This plant violates every labor law in the book. We found a missing Brazilian soccer team working in your reactor core. That plane crashed on my property! Look, Mr. Burns. We want to see some changes. For starters, you can reverse your sexist employment policies and hire at least one woman. All right, I\\'ll bring in a woman. But I still stand by my hiring policies. Get back to work, Stuart! Now with my new HMO I can provide every medical service you\\'ll ever need under one roof. You do have insurance, don\\'t you? Well that\\'s wonderful. Heh heh heh. Let\\'s go visit our optometrist. Your son has a temporary condition called \"lazy eye,\" where one eye is weaker than the other. You\\'ll have to wear these for two weeks. Menachem Begin wore a pair just like them. Hmmm, that scalp\\'s a little dry. Better see our dermatologist. Rub a palm full of this medicated salve into your scalp every half an hour. Keep him away from open flames and pregnant women. Ah, these should help those fallen arches. Enjoy. Hmmm, throat looks a little red. I\\'d better spray it. Whoa, thanks nice lady. My voice is crazy with the spraying already. Ayy, I feel so much better mister medical science-type person. Aw, if they hire a woman we won\\'t be able to spit on the floor. And we can\\'t take off our pants when it gets real hot. And we won\\'t be able to pee in the drinking fountain. I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did. Gentlemen, I\\'d like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy Simmons. I think she has a degree in engineering or something. Hi. How\\'s it goin\\'? Pleased to meet ya. Yeah, ditto. Hi. Homer, what\\'s the matter? Ain\\'t you ever seen a naked chick ridin\\' a clam before? Gotta go. What the hell was that? I probably shouldn\\'t have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot. Nice glasses, four eyes. Yeah. Nice shoes... uh... two feet. Your appearance is comical to me. I\\'m a nerd. So am I. Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens. Have a good night, Homer. You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke. HOMER LOVES MINDY... HOMER LOVES MINDY... Hey Homer. You\\'re hallucinatin\\' again. Not a good sign. So uh, what do you guys think of Mindy? Seems okay. Anybody see the game last night? Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice. Homer, what\\'s with you? You\\'re talking during a coffee break. Yeah, usually you just take the box of donuts into the bathroom. Mindy has a motorcycle. Look everybody! I\\'m the same person I always was. Hey, he\\'s learning on his own! Get \\'em! Moe, I need your advice. Yeah. See, I got this friend named... Joey Joe Joe Junior... Schabadoo. That\\'s the worst name I ever heard. Hey, Joey Joe Joe! Oh, what the hell, it\\'s me. I\\'m attracted to another woman. What am I going to do? \"Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you\\'ll realize you have nothing in common.\" Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that? It was on one of these bar napkins. Uh, so. Let\\'s have a conversation. Uh, I think we\\'ll find we have very little in common. Can\\'t talk... eating. Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze. Double glaze. Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV. Not me. That\\'s my idea of heaven. Me too. Really? I can see I\\'m gonna love working with you. Well, gotta go. I wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch. Foul temptress! I\\'ll bet she thinks Ziggy\\'s gotten too preachy, too. I made it the whole day without seeing her again. I mean hello! I guess we\\'ll be going down together. I mean getting off together. I mean... That\\'s okay. I\\'ll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator. That\\'s unsexy. Ew. Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts. Well, this is my floor. Arr - see ya tomorrow. Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for? Hi, Hober. Dote kiss be, I\\'b all stuffed up. Uhhh. Hi, Dad. Hi, son. Howya... ewww. Dad, look, I made fish sticks. They\\'re burned on the outside, but they\\'re frozen on the inside so it balances out. Yeah, good. That raccoon stole my lamb chop. Let\\'s have a little quality time together, just you and me. Oh that\\'s sweet. Guess what. There\\'s a new place at the mall - they\\'ll put your picture on a T-shirt. I got two dollars off because mine got smeared. Hey! We haven\\'t watched TV in awhile. Tonight Eye on Springfield takes a look at the secret affairs of Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush, and Clinton. Did fooling around on their wives make them great? We\\'ll find out next when we play \"Hail to the Cheat.\" The Burmese Melon Fly has over a thousand sex partners, and suffers virtually no guilt. Ooh, just do it! Examine your scalp for ringworm. Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman. Homer Simpson! That\\'s a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let\\'s conference you with Marge, huh? Nooo! Who are you? Homer, I\\'m your guardian angel. I\\'ve assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isa-who? Oh, very well. Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters? I\\'m not actually Col. Klink. I\\'m just assuming his form. Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp? Ho-MER! That\\'s not why I\\'m here. My job is to show you how miserable life would be if you married Mindy instead of Marge. Ooh, I would live in a big mansion? I\\'m so happy, darling. I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves? Yes, sir. Quite. Then we\\'re all happy. Let\\'s get out of here! Sure, life is good for you, but what about Marge? Marge lives here? Madam President, your approval rating is soaring. This dream is over. Hey, you! Get out of my office! Nerd!/Freak!/Different! You\\'re goofy lookin\\'! Whoa, what the hell... Shhh! What is this place? The refuge of the damned. A place where we can work on our extra credit assignments without fear of reprisal. Come, you must be tired from the chase. Oliver, bring our friend a hard boiled egg and some prune juice. Finally, Bart\\'s one of us. Excelsior! OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I... Uh oh. Dad, why are you singing? Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It\\'s not much, but it\\'s a start. Are you hiding something from me? Like what? Judging from your song, you\\'re infatuated with a woman named Mindy... or a man named Andy. Lisa, look out behind you! Dad, I\\'m not gonna fall for that. No, Lisa, I swear to you. I\\'m one-hundred percent completely serious. You\\'ve got to turn around right now before it\\'s too late. Huh? Sucker. Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on. Max, what I did I did because of alcohol and anger. I\\'m tired of these jokes about my giant hand. The first such incidence occurred in nineteen fifty-six when... Hi, Homer. Mindy! Oh no! I\\'m sweating like Roger Ebert. Uh, Murphy, you are elf a controllably I think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo. Look at those two inseparable chums, Smithers. That\\'s exactly the teamwork we\\'d like to showcase at this year\\'s Energy Convention. Are you sure, sir? Well no one else seems to share the same spirit of camaraderie. Simpson. Simmons. You two have been chosen to represent us at the National Energy Convention. Congratulations. You\\'ll be spending two nights together in glamorous Capital City. Wow! Capital City - The Windy Apple! Come on, I\\'ll get you the tickets. Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me? What is it? Do you have a question? Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot? He did? Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I\\'m gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That\\'s it. Free mouthwash! Free shampoo! Free shower curtain! Free shower curtain! Mindy? Homer? Wow, if it weren\\'t for this wall we\\'d be sleeping in the same bed. Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today\\'s society. Heh heh. Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble. Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation. No, Homer. Let\\'s do it. Let\\'s call room service! Oh! Someone is charging room service to the company, sir. Well we\\'ll just see about that. Fly my pretties! Fly! Continue the research. I can\\'t believe we ordered so much. Oh. Something\\'s missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed. Mmmm... foot long chili dog. It\\'s a sign! Good news, honey. Two weeks are up. You don\\'t have to wear your glasses anymore. And your scalp and posture seem fine. Yes! Kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes? I did. Okilly dokilly. We\\'ve been doing a lot of upper body work on Bart. Today let\\'s pound his kidneys. Let\\'s get...huh? What gives? Gentlemen, the nerd you knew is dead. Beat me and you will be beating one of your own. Whatever. So this stuff really works? Certainly does. Oh well, lots of luck! Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard! Get bent! No more Chernobyls! Go to hell! Heh, you know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but I think as long as we\\'re not alone together... And now the moment you\\'ve been waiting for. This year\\'s King and Queen of Energy are... Homer Simpson and Mindy Simmons! Huh? Homer, Mindy, you\\'ve just won a romantic dinner alone, at Madame Chao\\'s, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City! Is there any way to get out of this? No! What a perfect evening. It was sure nice of them to make us cheeseburgers. Oh yeah. Hey, we\\'re out of these \"new love\" cookies. Well, open up the \"stick with your wife\" barrel. Well I guess you\\'ll want to come in. Okay. Okay. This was a really nice night, Homer. Yeah, yeah. What\\'s wrong? Oh yeah. Like you don\\'t know. We\\'re gonna have sex. Oh... well, we don\\'t have to. Yes we do. The cookie told me so. Well, desserts aren\\'t always right. But they\\'re so sweet. Homer, you don\\'t have to do anything you don\\'t want to. Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I\\'d just like to... Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it\\'s up to you. Look in your heart. I think you\\'ll see what you want. Oh, baby. This was a wonderful idea, Homie. Hey, there\\'s a turkey behind the bed. Mmmm... Marge. OH, MARGIE, YOU CAME AND YOU FOUND ME A TURKEY, ON MY VACATION AWAY FROM WORKEY... The \"News on Parade\" Corporation presents ... \"News... on... Parade!\"... Corporation... News! Bringing you the world of... Current Events! ... New gadgets! ... and Hollywood! Look! It\\'s Amos from radio\\'s Amos and Andy! Hello, everybody! Springfield -- City on the Grow! It\\'s a proud day as Springfield is declared one of America\\'s 400 fastest-growing cities! And why not? Business is booming -- half the country wears Springfield Galoshes! And say hello to the state\\'s first Aqua-Car factory! Keep \\'em coming, boys! The city\\'s even in the celebrity business -- everyone knows Professor Rubber-Mouth hails from Springfield! Everybody\\'s chipping in -- even this fella has Springfield\\'s can-do spirit! So watch out, Utica -- Springfield is a city on the grow! They are. Got any spare change, man? Yes and you ain\\'t gettin\\' it. Everybody wants somethin\\' for nothin\\'. I\\'m old. Gimme, gimme, gimme! Hey, there\\'s something you don\\'t see in a toilet every day. Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo! The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides. That\\'s a right triangle, you idiot. Thank you so much for visiting our plant, Dr. Kissinger. It was fun. We\\'ll let you know if your glasses turn up. Er, yeah, I\\'m sure I left them in the car. No one must know I dropped them in the toilet. Not I, the man who drafted the Paris Peace Accords... Sir, bad news from accounting. The economy\\'s hit us pretty hard. Hey, tough times, eh? I\\'ve lived through twelve recessions, eight panics, and five years of McKinley-nomics. I\\'ll survive this! Well, even so, sir. We could stand to lay off a few employees. Oh! Very well -- lay off... Him, him, him, him... Hmm, better keep the egghead. He just might come in handy. Dad, you shouldn\\'t wear glasses that weren\\'t prescribed for you. Lisa, just because you\\'re ten feet tall doesn\\'t mean you can tell me what to do. I\\'m Bart. Gimme those. ... and finally, Henry Kissinger was hospitalized today after walking into a wall. Now over to Kent Brockman with some grim economic news. Scott, things aren\\'t as happy as they used to be down here at the unemployment office. Joblessness is no longer just for philosophy majors -- useful people are starting to feel the pinch. I haven\\'t been able to find a job in six years! Huh, and what training do you have? Five years of modern dance, six years of tap. The economic slump began last spring when the government closed Fort Springfield, devastating the city\\'s liquor and prostitution industries. Now, at the risk of being unpopular, this reporter places the blame for all this squarely on you, the viewers. I propose that I use what\\'s left of the town treasury to move to a more prosperous town and run for mayor. And uh, once elected, I will send for the rest of you. Boo! Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. The uh chair recognizes the little chick with the gleam of hope in her eyes. Thank you. This piggy bank contains fifteen dollars I\\'ve saved from my allowance. It isn\\'t much, but I would like to help. Aw, just what I need to tip the skycaps. I\\'ll tell you what made this town great! Good old-fashioned gumption! There\\'s nothing here a little elbow grease won\\'t fix! So let\\'s roll up our sleeves and... People! People, let\\'s be a little more realistic... Now, I uh hesitate to bring this up, but a number of cities have rejuvenated their economies with uh, legalized gambling. Uh, there is an added bonus -- some of the revenue can go to help our under-funded public schools! Well, I like the part about the gambling. What do you think, Reverend? Once something has been approved by the government, it\\'s no longer immoral. Yay! By building a casino, I could tighten my stranglehold on this dismal town! Yay! Yay! Well, now. Are there any objections? Actually, I think it might really help our economy. Very well, then. Instead of fleeing this town, I\\'ll stay here and grow fat off kickbacks and slush funds. Yay! This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield. And you know what the best part is? We\\'ve really done something for the children. We\\'re thrilled you\\'ve decided to build your casino on our waterfront. Oh, I\\'ll never forget my carefree boyhood days on this old boardwalk... Why you! Er, Master Burns! I mean, carry on. Ah, me leg\\'s gone gimpy! Oh, who\\'ll provide for me little ones? What was I laughing at, now? Oh yes, that crippled Irishman. Sir, the designers are here with some prototypes for your casino. Gentlemen, I give you, \"Britannia!\" Gambling with all the glitz and glamour of the British Isles! And best of all... the waitresses and showgirls are all real Brits! Fresh from the streets of Sussex, they are! Freshen your drink, guv\\'nor? Get out! Okay, alright, wait, now now dig this man... Get out! Oh wow oh... let me just get my head together... Now! I\\'ll need three ships and fifty stout men! We\\'ll sail \\'round The Horn and return with spices and silk, the likes of which ye have never seen! We\\'re building a casino. Arr. Can ye give me five minutes? Idiots. I\\'ll design it myself. I know what people like. It\\'s got to have sex appeal, and a catchy name. Mom, we\\'re having a geography pageant at school, and I don\\'t know which state to go as. In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of Nevada? No. Nevada makes my butt look big. Then how \\'about going as Florida? You enjoy orange juice, and old people like you. Dad, what do you think? Shhh. I\\'m trying to teach the baby to gamble. Why? I got a job at Burns\\' casino. As you know, it\\'s been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer. Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on \"The Gong Show.\" And you did it in 1977, remember? We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire. Hello, I\\'m retired heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney. Welcome to Mr. Burns\\' Casino. If there\\'s anything I can do to make your visit more enjoyable, please just let me know. Yeah, great. See ya... Uh, don\\'t forget to apply for our VIP Platinum club for special discounts on... Hey! I said bug off! Uh, let\\'s see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again. Yee ha! Homer, I want you to have my lucky hat. I wore it the day Kennedy was shot, and it allllways brings me good luck! Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over. Come on lucky seven! Papa needs a new pair of spats! I want some of that sweet, sweet do-re-mi! Fat City, here I come! Please throw the dice now, please now! Don\\'t rush me, I have arthritis. Will the gentleman please roll the dice. All right, all right, smart guy. Oh, for cryin\\' out loud, I dropped one... Oh now it\\'s in my shoe. Ow! Ow! Ooh! A round of applause for Anastasia! She loves show business -- so much nicer than the savagery of the jungle, huh. Hey tiger, wake up. Woo Hoo! Jackpot! Wait a minute, are you over twenty-one? Are you? I\\'m not authorized to answer that. By the way, your martinis suck! Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? Start your own casino? In your treehouse? And get all your little friends to come? I\\'d like to see that. Ah yeah, welcome... have a lucky day... um hmmm. Well, he certainly showed me. Hi, Homie. Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino. I was for the casino! Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory. Legalized gambling is a bad idea. You can build a casino over my dead body! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... For you. It\\'s the President. Y\\'ello? And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge? I wonder if they have a lost and found. Oh, what the hey. Hey, how\\'s it goin\\'?... Hey, good to see you... Tell your friends. Lookin\\' lucky... Hey, what\\'s happenin\\'? Love THE jacket. Behold the box of mystery! The cat goes in... uh... Twenty- one? Do that card-counting thing again! Come on. Do it again. Definitely have to leave the table. No! Please, please, please, please, please... Gotta watch Wapner. Leave the table. Yeah, leave the table. No! Sir, you haven\\'t slept since the casino opened, five days ago. Well, I\\'ve discovered the perfect business. People swarm in, empty their pockets, and scuttle off. Nothing can stop me now. Except microscopic germs. But we won\\'t let that happen. Will we Smithers? Uh... No, sir. Whoa, a baby on the table! That\\'s good luck! Yayyy! Snake eyes. Sorry. Booo! Gawrsh! It must be exciting to live in the cas-een-oh! Ja! You know, we\\'re having a party tonight... Huh, Marge, you gotta watch out! Your little boy Bart coulda been eaten by that pony! Oh my God, Barney, thank you. I would never have forgiven myself. Now you stay put, young lady. Man, that\\'s classic compulsive behavior! Wow, free beer. Buddy, those are my quarters! Hey, this guy\\'s paying off! I don\\'t wanna hit a \"sore\" spot, but can we talk about herpes? \"HERPES HERPES BO BERPES / BANANA FANNA FO BERPES\"... HERPES! Ow! Hey, that spot on Gorbachev\\'s head? Herpes, trust me... Anybody here have herpes? Huh? Huh? You people are the worst audience I\\'ve ever seen. Well, you\\'re the worst comedian we\\'ve ever seen! Oh, great. Well we\\'ll just sit here silently for the next ninety minutes. Fine with us. They\\'re all covered with filthy germs, aren\\'t they, Smithers?! Why, what do you mean, sir? Ewww! Marge, you waited for me. Okay, Marge, let\\'s go. I\\'ll catch up to you. Marge, I\\'m taking the car. I\\'ll walk. This late? Through the bad neighborhood? Yeah. Marge... Go home. You\\'re bad luck! Wait. I see what\\'s happening here. You\\'re just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that\\'s just sad. What?! Um, excuse me, Ma\\'am. Don\\'t you think you\\'ve gambled enough? No. Okay. We\\'re required by law to ask every seventy-five hours. Get her another free drink. Double stars. Everybody wins. Do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? I mean we haven\\'t had a meal with Mom all week. And she hasn\\'t even started my costume for the Geography Pageant. Pipe down, sister. I\\'ve gotta book a new act for tonight. Turns out that Liza Minelli impersonator was really Liza Minelli. There\\'s nothing to eat for breakfast. You\\'ve gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust. Maybe Mom just doesn\\'t realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know. Ah, come on, Lisa, there\\'s no reason to... Let\\'s go see Mom. Marge, we need to talk. You\\'re spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem... I won sixty dollars last night. Woo hoo! Problem solved! Smithers, I\\'ve designed a new plane. I call it the Spruce Moose, and it will carry two hundred passengers from New York\\'s Idlewild Airport to the Belgian Congo in seventeen minutes. That\\'s quite a nice model, sir. Model? Mommm! Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What\\'s up? I just had a bad dream. Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it. Well, I know it\\'s absurd, but I dreamed the Boogeyman was after me and he\\'s hiding... Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I\\'ll get the gun! Bart, I don\\'t want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house! What happened here? Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would\\'ve happened if you\\'d been here to keep me from acting stupid. Oh, I\\'m sorry. I have been spending too much time at the casino. I\\'ll be around more from now on. Does this mean you\\'ll help me with my costume? Sure, honey. I promise. Thanks, Mom. Aw. Just like on TV. Hi. Are you from the casino? I\\'m from a casino. Good enough. Let\\'s go. I\\'m afraid Robert Goulet hasn\\'t arrived yet, Sir. Very well, begin the thawing of Jim Nabors. Are you sure this is the casino? I think I should call my manager. Your manager says for you to shut up! Vera said that? Hmmm. Dad, Mom said she\\'d be home to help me with my costume, and she\\'s not and the Geography Pageant is tonight. Lisa, your mom still loves you. It\\'s just that she has a career, now. She\\'s a slot jockey. But Dad, if I don\\'t show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida, I\\'ll be the laughing stock of the whole school. It\\'s always something isn\\'t it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this. Ow...ow...ow...ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Dad! Oh yeah, the costume. Hello, Floreeda. I\\'m not a state, I\\'m a monster! No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it\\'s time to snatch your mother from his neon claws. Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino! Seven. Lucky seven. Can\\'t talk now. Smithers! I don\\'t want that unpredictable lunatic working in my casino! Fine. We\\'ll transfer him to the nuclear plant, sir. Oh, my beloved plant... How I miss her. Bah! To hell with this! Get my razor! Draw a bath! And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet! Certainly, sir. And the jars of urine? Oh, we\\'ll hang on to those. Now, to the plant! We\\'ll take the Spruce Moose. Hop in. But sir... I said, hop in. Homer! What is it? Slow down. Think before you say each word. You broke a promise to your child. What? You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She\\'s such a little trooper. Lisa\\'s costume. Homer, I didn\\'t realize. I\\'m so sorry. Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem. You know, you\\'re right, Homer. Maybe I should get some professional help. No no, that\\'s too expensive. Just don\\'t do it anymore. JINGLE BELLS / BATMAN SMELLS / ROBIN LAID AN EGG! / BATMOBILE LOST ITS WHEEL / AND THE JOKER GOT AWAY! HEY! Thank you... Thank you very much. Ooh. I\\'m sorry, kid. And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no help from their parents, Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum. I\\'m Idaho. Yes, of course you are. Can\\'t talk. Robbed. Go hell. You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem. That\\'s true. Will you forgive me? Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears? Well, that\\'s nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house \\'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus? Well, you have a gambling problem! Homer, when you forgive someone, you can\\'t throw it back at them like that. Aw, what a gyp. And remember when I... Homer! Oh yeah. I forgot already. Dad! We\\'ve been robbed! Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone. Woo hoo! And our portable TV! And my necklace. Eh, that\\'s no big loss. Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom. Oh, you\\'ve probably got a whole drawer full of \\'em. Well... Yes, I do. But they\\'re all heirlooms, too. The burglar even took my stamp collection. YOU had a stamp collection? Stamp collection. Haw haw! Bart\\'s pain is funny, but mine isn\\'t. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself. Shhh, quiet Lisa. Hey, the burglar left his calling card. You have just been robbed by The Springfield Cat Burglar... Cute. Hidilly ho, neighboreenos. You folks got robbed too? The burglar took my Shroud of Turin beach towels. Wow. It\\'s a crime wave. Good Lord! My Stormin\\' Norman Commemorative Plates stolen... again. Hey! I thought I had more stuff than this. We are insured, aren\\'t we, Mom? Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance. Curse you, Magic Beans. Oh, stop blaming the beans. Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery! A robbery, right. Thanks for the report. Another one, Lou. 723 Evergreen Terrace. Well, there doesn\\'t seem to be any pattern, yet. But if I take this one and move it here, and move these over here... Hello... It almost looks like an arrow. Hey look, Chief. It\\'s pointing right at this police station. Let\\'s get outta here! When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind? This reporter isn\\'t saying that the burglar is an inhuman monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be. So, professor, would you say it\\'s time for everyone to panic? Yes I would, Kent. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen please, we have a major break in the case. We recovered the burglar\\'s handkerchief from one of the crime scenes. Now one sniff of this baby and our tracking dog will be hot on his trail. Gosh, look at me, I\\'m sweating like a pig here... Ahhh. Aw man... that\\'s better. Alright, get the scent, boy. Come on. Get the scent. Now kill! Go on. Ow, my jugular! Any questions? Let me check my reason list. Yep. It\\'s on here. Well, as you can see, when the burglar trips the alarm, the house raises from its foundations and runs down the street and around a corner to safety. Well, the the real humans won\\'t uh.. won\\'t burn quite so fast there. Cool! High-tech security system. Alright, free laserium. All the colors of the bow, man. My cataracts are gone! I can see again! All the beauty of nat... I\\'m blind! Oh well, easy come easy go. It\\'s the cat burglar! Please, don\\'t kill me! Abe, can I use your ointment? Oh, it\\'s you, Molloy. Alright. But this time clean off the applicator. Thank you for coming. I\\'ll see you in Hell. Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you\\'re not followed, lock all doors and windows. And don\\'t take candy from strangers. Marge, they\\'re only human. What\\'s the point of all these precautions? I\\'ve already lost the only thing that matters to me. Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument. What, this jug? Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down. Aw, honey. I didn\\'t realize how much that horn meant to you. Don\\'t worry. Daddy\\'s gonna get it back. I don\\'t know how, but I\\'ll figure out something. Thank you. You know Lisa, music helps daddy think. Hey, you\\'re that drunken posse. Wow, can I join you? I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs? Can I?! Welcome, neighbors... since the police can\\'t seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it\\'s time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni! Now, who should lead the group? You! Yeah! Flanders! Flanders! Flanders! I don\\'t really have very much experience, but I\\'ll be--- Someone else! Yeah! Someone else! Someone else! Someone else! I\\'m someone else! He\\'s right! We don\\'t need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who\\'ll act without considering the consequences. Homer! Homer! Homer! I\\'m with you, Homer. I be with ya too, matey. I\\'m with you, Homer. You\\'re the man, Homer. You\\'re so good. You\\'re the man, man. I\\'ll join! I\\'m filled with piss and vinegar. At first I was just filled with vinegar... Sorry, Dad. You\\'re too old. Too old! Why that just means I have experience. Who chased the Irish out of Springfield Village in ought four? Me, that\\'s who! And a fine job ye did too! Aw, Dad, you\\'ve done a lot of great things, but you\\'re a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren\\'t they? Aren\\'t they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are... Stop it! It\\'s a form of abuse! I don\\'t think the guns are a good idea, Homer. Marge, we\\'re responsible adults and... Oops. ... and if a group of responsible adults can\\'t handle firearms in a responsible way... Sorry. Uh-oh! Me again. Sorry. Okay, we\\'ve got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I\\'ll be \"Cueball.\" Skinner can be \"Eightball\", Barney will be \"Twelveball,\" and Moe, you can be \"Cueball.\" You\\'re an idiot. So, wedding, huh? No, we\\'re forming a vigilante group. Come with me. See, it\\'s a miniature version of the A-bomb. The government built it in the fifties to drop on beatniks. Radiant cool crazy nightmare. Zen New Jersey nowhere. Put this in your pipe and smoke it. How now brown bureaucrats. Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo! Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs! Hey, see this sign? Sorry. Okay, men, it\\'s time to clean up this town. Meaning what exactly? You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big. Bart, give me that megaphone of yours. It\\'s not just a megaphone, Dad. It\\'s a RapMaster 2000. Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I\\'ve got to whip this neighborhood into shape. Move along there. It\\'s Hammer! Return to your homes and places of businesses! Hey you, where\\'d you get that saxophone? Sears. Get him! No burning leaves without a permit! I got one. Too late. You better have a good reason for doing that, boy. It makes me feel like a big man. You\\'re in. Here\\'s the sack. But you gotta supply your own knobs. So I said to him, \"Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn\\'t have mouthed off like that.\" Dad, don\\'t you see you\\'re abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you\\'re the police, who will police the police? I \\'unno. Coast Guard? Homer, wasn\\'t the whole point to catch the cat burglar? And I still don\\'t have my saxophone. Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we\\'ve also expanded into other important areas. Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination... World domination? Oh, that might be a typo. Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent? Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that. I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it\\'s been preventing? Oh, Kent, I\\'d be lying if I said my men weren\\'t committing crimes. TouchÃ©. Well, it looks like we have our first caller. And I mean ever, because this is not a call-in show. Hello, you\\'re on the air. Hello, Kent. Hello, Homer, my arch nemesis. Y\\'ello. Uh, you do realize who this is... Uh... Marge? No, Homer, I\\'m not your wife, although I do enjoy her pearls. As a matter of fact, I\\'m holding them right now. Listen. Why you monster! And you have my daughter\\'s saxophone too! Homer, that\\'s our stage manager! Oh sorry. I\\'m a little nervous. It may interest you to know that for my next crime I\\'ll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world\\'s largest cubic zirconia. Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time. We\\'ll be right back. I get to say that. Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg. Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don\\'t steal anything. Hey! We\\'re on our break! Any sign of the burglar yet? He\\'ll show. How\\'s that? It\\'s his job. How\\'s that? He\\'s a burglar. Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you\\'d like to get in here, wouldn\\'t you? There\\'s just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Asleep at the switch! I wasn\\'t asleep! I was drunk! I believe you, Dad. Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do. Go home, Simpson. You let me down, man. Now I don\\'t believe in nothing no more. I\\'m going to law school. Nooooo! Dad, maybe this will cheer you up. Oh, this doesn\\'t work any more. I didn\\'t say stop. Oh my! I had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia. Let me through! Coming through! Oh, Grampa. They pelted you too? No. Actually I fell down at the Big Boy. Son, I\\'ve come to help you. I know who the cat burglar is. What? Who? Huh? What? Well, well, well. Before I was too old and no one wanted my help. Suddenly, look who comes to old Grampa for--wait! Where\\'re you going? Come back. I\\'ll tell you. He was right under my nose the whole time. He lives in my retirement home. His name is Molloy. Wow! How\\'d you track him down, Grampa? Good question. On one of my frequent trips to the ground... I noticed Molloy wore sneakers. For sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum. We felt slighted by your age-bashing and started home. Molloy said, \\'I\\'ll catch up with you.\\' I couldn\\'t quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world\\'s largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table. Aw, Dad, I could kiss you. Well kiss me right here. It\\'s the only part that still has feeling. No wait! I know where the burglar is! To the retirement home! Hooray! And there she is: the world\\'s largest cubic zirconia. What an eyesore. So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him. How ironic. Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I\\'m glad it was you. Actually, it wasn\\'t me. It was my Dad, Grampa. Thanks, son. So you see old people aren\\'t so useless after all. Molloy\\'s old and he outsmarted the lot of ya. And I\\'m even older and I outsmarted him. Shut up. I\\'ve had my moment. And of course, I\\'m happy to return all of your treasured possessions. Selma, my dear, your lock of MacGyver\\'s hair. Thank you. I\\'ll add it to the ball. And little Lisa, here\\'s your saxophone. Thank you. And thank you, Dad. You got it back, just like you said you would. I sincerely regret any inconvenience I may have caused. And although I have stolen your material goods, let me assure you that your dear town has stolen my heart. Awwwww. Oh, he\\'s so charming! Let\\'s let him go. Yeah! Oh, sorry, folks. Gee, I really hate to spoil this little love-in, but Mr. Molloy broke the law. And when you break the law, you gotta go to jail. Uh, that reminds me, uh, here\\'s your monthly kickback. You just, you couldn\\'t have picked a worse time. I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar. I suppose you\\'re wondering where I hid all the millions of dollars I stole over the years. Shut up. Oh, wait a minute. Maybe we should uh, hear him out. Where\\'d you hide the loot, Molloy? It\\'s buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T. No kidding. Big T, huh? Well, I guess I\\'ll be going to my home now and... sleep. Yeah, me too. I will also go home for sleep. Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There\\'s millions of dollars buried under a Big T! We need more information. It\\'s buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road. Ah, you take highway 201 south for 15 minutes... take a left at the left. Oh, that was fun, ladies! Whatsa matter with you, kid? You told me the stream was shallow. Why you... oh kid... I\\'ll kill you... Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for some unknown reason. Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is, would you say it\\'s time for our viewers to crack each other\\'s heads open and feast on the goo inside? Yes I would, Kent. Whoa, I found something! It\\'s just a piece of paper. It\\'s mine! \"Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes.\" Oh, I can\\'t make out this signature. Keep digging. We\\'re bound to find something. Hmmm. I guess we\\'re not gonna find anything. Uh, how\\'re we gonna get outta here? We\\'ll dig our way out! No, no! Dig up, stupid! Ahh, the morning horoscope. \"Today will be a day like every other day.\" It just gets worse and worse. Bart, I\\'ve asked you not to whistle that annoying tune. Jawohl, mein mommandant. Why are you so happy? Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge. You\\'re right, Bart. School is for losers. And that\\'s how I cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of TV\\'s \"Facts Of Life\", including long time hold-out, Tootie. Sounds like another Pulitzer for me to polish. Hush, field trip boy. Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize. How ironic. Yo! Lis! Lis! Come back, Lis! Come back! Why? I\\'m so much happier here. And now Principal Skinner will tell us where we\\'ll be going on this year\\'s field trip. Thank you, Edna, everyone. Now class... I wonder who among you can tell me what this is? Not the box factory again, Seymour. This may well prove fascinating. I know, I\\'ll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy. Class, instead of going to the box factory, today we\\'ll be going to the... box factory. Damn TV, you\\'ve ruined my imagination just like you\\'ve ruined my ability to... to um, uh... oh well. FIFTY-SIX BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL / FIFTY-SIX BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER / YOU TAKE ONE DOWN AND PASS IT A-ROUND/ FIFTY-FIVE BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL! Ohhh! The story of how two brothers - and five other men - parlayed a small business loan into a thriving paper goods concern is a long and interesting one. And here it is. It all began with the filing of form 637 slash A, the application for a small business or farm... Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes over the years. Textiles... other boxes... even children\\'s candy. Do any of these boxes have candy in \\'em? No. Will they ever? No. We only make boxes to ship nails. Any other questions? When will we be able to see a finished box, sir? Oh, we don\\'t assemble \\'em here. That\\'s done in Flint, Michigan. Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery? No... ...And then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody? No, that has never happened. Any popped eyeballs? I\\'m not sure what kind of factory you\\'re thinking of. We just make boxes here. This room is the most popular part of our tour. It\\'s just like the other rooms. Yes, but with one important difference. Oh. We took that out. Yes, it is just like the other rooms. What\\'s that building over there? That\\'s just the TV studio where they film Krusty the Clown and other non-box-related programs. Since it has nothing to do with boxes, I\\'ll just shut these blinds. Now here\\'s my office. If you will direct your eyes to the floor, you\\'ll see a yellow line. Follow it. It will lead you around my desk ...and back out the door. I gotta get outta here. Aha! The perfect escape! Do you work here, little boy? Yeah. Well then go right in, sir. Bart! / Where are you! I\\'ll handle this. Simpson! I\\'m giving you \\'til the count of three to come out. One... two... three. I\\'ve done all I can do. We\\'d better call his parents. Just a minute! Don\\'t hang up! Buzz off, Giuseppe. No answer at home. I\\'ll call his father. Just a minute! Don\\'t hang up! Y\\'ello... you\\'ll have to speak up, I\\'m wearing a towel. Action! Ayy yi yi! No me gusta! I\\'m sorry, I\\'m really not comfortable with this, Ethan. What\\'s the matter, love? It\\'s just, it\\'s it\\'s the same old tired gags, isn\\'t it? I mean, let\\'s give the audience some credit.
